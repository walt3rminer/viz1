This would be achieved by: (i) protecting the existing biodiversity in and around reserve areas; (ii) identifying habitats and "hotspots" of endemic species in need of greater protection; (iii) developing a comprehensive strategy and action plans to manage and conserve the savanna biodiversity; (iv) adopting an integrated ecosystem management approach; (v) protecting sacred groves, other dedicated community reserves and other sources of biodiversity such as threatened medicinal plants through cultivation and conservation; (vi) preserving local knowledge of biodiversity management and use including traditional phytomedicines; and (vii) supporting the cultivation and protection of indigenous and threatened farmer crop varieties.  The project duration is six years, with PY1 beginning in 2002 and PY6 ending in 2008. Factors on which GO is based are: ·,,Hectares of savanna priority areas, including on and off reserves under effective management; ·,,Number of regeneration of threatened, endemic and rare biotic species in the priority areas; ·,,Number of communities effectively involved in propagation of important indigenous crops and medicinal plants; ·,,Number of hectares put under cultivation of farmer crop varieties and medicinal plant species; ·,,Percentage reduction in encroachment of natural habitats; and ·,,Percentage rehabilitation of degraded lands and restocking of wildlife protected areas.</a><br />
