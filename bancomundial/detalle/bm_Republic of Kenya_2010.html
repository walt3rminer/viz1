This would be done through:(i) sustaining the improved institutional performance of the National AIDS Control Council (NACC); and (ii) supporting the implementation of the Kenya National AIDS Strategic Plan (KNASP).  The Project Development Objectives are to: (a) expand the coverage of targeted HIV and AIDS prevention and mitigation measures; and(b) expand access to bed nets among targeted people living with HIV and AIDS  and other households in malaria risk areas.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P122163" target=_blank>The objective is to bring together infoDev's experience with ICT-enabled innovation and entrepreneurship, in particular its African network of business incubators, with Nokia's expertise on mobile applications in emerging markets in order to extend mobile applications in Africa. The expected impact is to increase the number of mobile applications entrepreneurs in Africa.  The expected intermediate results are the hosting of events (around 30 in four cities in the first 18 months of the project) to promote innovation in the mobile sphere, targeting around 1000 participants from 400 or so companies, NGOs, government agencies and other organizations that would participate in the online and offline actvities, and promoting the visibility of the African chapters at a global level, for instance through a dedicated webspace and competititions with winners to gain entry to international events, such as infoDev's Global Forum for Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Helsinki (May/June 2011). The main knowledge output of this activity will be inputs to the Mobile Flagship Report (GLO 1 under TF071399) to evaluate lessons learned from this experiment in social networking and to show the development potential of mobile applications.</a><br />

Expected outcomes include that smallholder farmers in Kenya will be able to access the carbon market and receive additional carbon revenue streams through the adoption of productivity enhancing practices and technologies.</a><br />

KAPSLMP?s development objective is to facilitate agricultural producers in the targeted operational areas to adopt environmentally-sound land management practices without reducing their incomes.  Performance monitoring will be based on outcome indicators at PDO level: (a) Percent increase in cultivated area in which promoted slm technologies and practices have been adopted in the project operational areas, (b) Percent increase in income of households from slm related intervention in the project operational areas, (c) A national institutional framework for slm planning, implementation and coordination established, and (d) Percent increase in vegetative cover in cultivated fields in the project operational areas.</a><br />

The Additional Financing would contribute to the first objective of the clarified Kenya Education Sector Support Project Development Objective: (i) improving equitable access to, and the quality of, primary education, and equitable access to secondary education in Kenya; and (ii) establishing the framework to create opportunities for post-basic education (TIVET and University) in Kenya.  Achievements would be measured by improvements in the Net Enrollment Ratio (NER), Primary Completion Rate (PCR), student achievement scores in the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE), and transition to secondary education. And B) At the secondary education level by restructuring the KESSP towards improving the efficiency, equity, and accountability of the secondary school bursary scheme so as to: increase access for poor students to secondary education, ensure the retention of those who enter secondary school, and enhance their chances for completing secondary education.  Two sub-activities would help to achieve the objective: (i) a pilot pro-poor secondary school bursaries grant to set up demonstration effect in support of reforms to the Ministry of Education (MOE) secondary schools bursary scheme, and more full-fledged support for the scheme over time based on sequenced reforms which would signal Government's commitment to pro-poor investment.  This sub-activity would result in the introduction of reforms to the ongoing MOE funds flow mechanism, and the student selection mechanism to qualify for bursaries; and (ii) a governance and accountability system.</a><br />
