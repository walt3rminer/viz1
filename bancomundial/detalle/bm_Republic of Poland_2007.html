This would be achieved by: (i) reducing the extreme flood peaks through storage in a dry polder on the Odra River just upstream o f Raciborz town, enabling a reduction o f the flood peak downstream o f the reservoir and allowing bettercontrol o f the operation o f t he river system; and (ii)by increasing the flood carrying capacity o f t he Odra River channels through and around Wroclaw. The Project would protect more than 2.5 million people against flooding in several towns such as Raciborz, Kedzierzyn, Kozle, Krapkowice, Opole, Brzeg, Olawa and Wroclaw, and settlements in the three voivodships o f Slaslue, Opolskie and Dolnoslaslue.</a><br />
