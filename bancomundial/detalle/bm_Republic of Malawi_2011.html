Cities Alliance provided a preparatory grant to LCA in 2008 for Phase 1, which was used to gather basic data about the city, conduct an institutional audit and prepare a stakeholder analysis.  During Phase 2,the City of Johannesburg mentored the LCA in developing the Lilongwe CDS, which includes a comprehensive overview of the city, a vision statement, goals, objectives and projects/activities. Phase 3 focuses on supporting the LCA to operationalize the CDS, and includes such organizational development tasks as: finalizing the LCA business plan and departmental score cards, formalizing a CDS Unit in the office of the Chief Executive, and setting up a reporting system on CDS-related activities for the departments.  Other activities include feasibility studies for the seven iconic projects highlighted in the CDS document, as well as awareness raising and advocacy on the CDS, including stakeholder meetings and road show.</a><br />
