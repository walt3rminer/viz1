The first is to further improve its financial management systems within a broader national reform agenda.  The second is to provide budgetary and fiduciary assurances to donors sufficient to ensure their financial support during the 2004 and 2005 budget years.  The Bank's Adjustment Operation was intended to: (1) provide budgetary support for the PA in a time of acute economic and fiscal crisis; (2) help leverage additional donor support for the Reform Trust Fund among other donors; and (3) help provide additional support for the PA's financial management reform agenda.  This Adjustment Operation was processed in parallel with the Reform Fund, and the agreed upon program of policy reforms, the matrix and the Letter of Development Policy (LDP) were the same.</a><br />

An additional objective would be to strengthen the institutional capacity of MOSA to manage cash transfer programs. The primary objective would be achieved by implementing a pilot incentive-based cash transfer mechanism with improved targeting modalities that would contribute to improving the living conditions of the beneficiaries.</a><br />
