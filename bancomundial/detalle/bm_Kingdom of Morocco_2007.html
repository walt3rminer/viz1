More specifically, the primary objectives of this Development Policy Loan (DPL) would be as follows: (i) help the Moroccan Government improve energy security through the development of domestic energy resources, efficient use of energy, and the formulation of a long-term energy import strategy; (ii) foster competition in the energy market through regional system integration, liberalization of the high-voltage domestic electricity market, and open access of competitors in the petroleum downstream market; and (iii) to reduce Government subsidies for petroleum products.</a><br />

Improved governance, financing arrangements, and policy coordination in the water sector   2. Enactment of integrated water resource management towards sustainable water uses.  3. Enhanced service, asset management and usage productivity in irrigation.  4. Better access to water and sanitation service, and increased wastewater treatment capacity.</a><br />

The project will also test the viability of solar thermal technology and co ntribute to replication of integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC) power generation technology in Morocco and elsewhere. It is one of  a number of similar projects in the world to be supported by GEF as part of a program to accelerate cost reduction and commercial a doption of large-scale low greenhouse emitting generation technologies. The main  global benefits of the project are: (a) contributi on to the demonstration o f operational viability of hybrid  solar thermal power generation in Morocco; (b) contribution to accelera ted market penetration of large-scale backstop power generation technologies; and (c) reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from pow er generation.</a><br />
