Intermediate objectives will include: (i) improving nutrition-related maternal and child feeding and caring practices; (ii) improving the population’s access to and use of safe sanitation facilities and uptake of better hygienic practices; (iii) improving the performance of primary andsecondary schools in health promotion and disease prevention; and (iv) increasing childhood immunization coverage and women’s access to quality maternal health services.The PDO results will be tracked at the level of the provinces participating in the project rather than at the national level.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P152525" target=_blank>The Project Development Objective is “To support the Republic of the Philippines and other development partners to establish a monit oring system for violent conflicts to inform plans, policies and programs in the Bangsamoro.” As the PDO suggests, the main object ive of the Bangsamoro Conflict Monitoring System is to enhance demand-driven policy dialogue, using BCMS data as a tool and platform , on issues related to conflict and development in the proposed Bangsamoro territory. Through this system, the Bank seeks to make av ailable data and analysis that can be used by government and non-government partners to inform more conflict-sensitive plans and pol icies to reduce violent conflict in the Bangsamoro. This will be achieved through regular and rigorous data collection, analysis and  dissemination.  The results of the BCMS will be used to inform policy-makers, non-government organizations and development partners  on conflict trends and patterns, primarily for the purpose of development planning.  The secondary objective is to strengthen the  capacity of local partner institutions to collect, analyze and use data. This is intended to sustain the project and to promote con crete actions at the local level to respond to conflict analysis.  This will be achieved by working with local academic institutions  for data collection and analysis and to promote coordinated responses to the findings of the system. This objective will also bepro moted by seeking to generate a shared understanding among key stakeholders of violent conflict trends, as well as an appreciation of  the localized and nuanced nature of conflict both temporally and spatially.  It is intended that this will, in turn, inform better targeted interventions in specific locations to help prevent and manage violent conflict. By tracking trends, the dataset should als o provide information on the impact of various conflict mitigation measures implemented by government, donors and other institutions . It will also provide policy-makers with nuanced and regular data on which to measure the immediate impact of the Comprehensive Agr eement on the Bangsamoro and the anticipated transition to the new Bangsamoro political entity on security conditions on the ground.</a><br />
