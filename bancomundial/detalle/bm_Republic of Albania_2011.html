In particular, the proposed reform agenda supported by this DPL includes the following:i. To improve the effectiveness of social safety nets, the DPL would support policies that (a)strengthen the mechanisms to allocate funds and select beneficiaries in the main social assistance program; (b) introduce incentives for investing in human capital by providing an additional benefit linked to school enrollment and attendance for families with school age children; (c) initiate the process to create a unified registry of beneficiaries of social assistance programs; and (d) change the indexation formula of the disability benefits program, to control the share of resources allocated to this program, which is growing disproportionately;ii. To enhance the efficiency and equity of health spending, the DPL would support policies to (a) introduce more predictable fiscal rules to finance health; (b) improve the methods for contracting with providers and the capacity to monitor their performance; and (c) grant health insurance coverage to social assistance beneficiaries.  The DPL would also enhance transparency and accountability by supporting policies to improve the administration of social assistance programs and promoting the use of systematic formulas to allocate resources in selected social programs and services</a><br />
