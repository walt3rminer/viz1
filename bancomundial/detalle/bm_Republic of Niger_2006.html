Within a medium-term framework, and building on the previous three budget support operations as well as ongoing investment projects in agriculture, education, and health, this RSRC series is focusing on overcoming policy constraints and institutional bottlenecks in public sector management, agricultural development, and human development, including demographic growth and gender issues.   The RSRC1 will focus on selected policy and institutional aspects related to:  1/ Improving public sector management by: (i) expanding reforms in public expenditure management (through increasing links between budget allocations and Government priorities as defined in PRSP, strengthening involvement of sectoral ministries in budget regulation and cash management, modernizing the Treasury, strengthening budget controls and improving the structure and functioning of the MEF); and (ii) enhancing the national statistical information system through insuring the preparation of national surveys on a regular basis.  2/ Promoting rural development and agricultural growth by:  (i) implementing the programs of the rural development strategy; (ii) promoting local governance of natural resources (agricultural land, irrigation water); (iii) adopting a single MTEF for the four rural ministries; and (iv) releasing funds allocated in the 2006 budget to ensure adequate food availability during the pre-harvest period.  3/ Improving service delivery in social sectors by: (i) enhancing human resource management; (ii) improving budget preparation and execution; (iii) enhancing accountability and governance at the school level; (iv) providing publicly financed basic health services to the poor and vulnerable groups; and (v) addressing demographic and gender dimensions.</a><br />
