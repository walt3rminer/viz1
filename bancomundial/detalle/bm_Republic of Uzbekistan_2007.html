In Samarkand, the city's solid waste management equipment currently represents only around 14 percent of the overall needs.   The Bukhara Samarkand Solid Waste Management Project would be a free-standing MSWM project based on the experience of the Tashkent Solid Waste Management Project and will vary slightly to take into account the lessons learned in Tashkent and the unique needs of Bukhara and Samarkand.  It is envisaged that the project would consist of a two phase investment.  The first phase would finance urgent solid waste equipment needs based on a rapid assessment, development of a strategic MSWM plan , follow-up technical and institutional development work, and project management support. Phase two would finance implementation of the strategic MSWM plan which would include:  institutional strengthening, waste collection equipment, landfill construction/upgrading, waste processing and landfill equipment, central repair and maintenance facility, and other equipment (for example, septic tank cleaning equipment, street cleaning, landscaping equipment, computers, and other equipment for meeting project objectives).</a><br />
