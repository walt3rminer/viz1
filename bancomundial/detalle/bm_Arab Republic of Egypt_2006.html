Such financing is scarce at present, in part because primary lenders do not have reliable access to sources of term finance on favorable terms that could help them to mitigate the associated business and lending risks.  The Egyptian Company for Mortgage Refinancing (ECMR) will provide such a source.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">500000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P088877" target=_blank>The main development objective of the government financial sector reform program, and of the proposed loan, is to build a more resilient financial sector, with a sound banking system and insurance industry, able in the medium-term, to provide modern and efficient financial services. The operation would assist Egypt move forward in strengthening the enabling environment for financial intermediation, resource mobilization and risk management, and increasing private sector role and participation in the provision of financial services. The operation would help, specifically to: (i) strengthen the domestic banking system  inter-alia by divesting fully public sector shares in joint venture banks, privatizing one of the large state-owned commercial banks, implementing institutional, operational and financial restructuring of the remaining public banks, and consolidating and merging small banks in an over banked market; (ii) develop and deepen the contractual savings system in restructuring the insurance industry so it play an effective role in risk management and transfer, and mobilization of long-term savings; and (iii) strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework for banks and non-bank financial institutions to ensure compliance with international standards and effective enforcement.</a><br />

The development objective outcome will be measured by the decrease in pollution loads in the selected hot spot areas. The target for this indicator will be the achievement of at least 75% reduction in the quantity of pollutants emitted by the target companies in each of the targeted hot spots. The proposed project will also be a vehicle for supporting the Government of Egypt to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the emerging carbon market established after the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol in February 2005.</a><br />
