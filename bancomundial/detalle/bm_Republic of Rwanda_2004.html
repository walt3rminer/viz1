This is a key plank in the national poverty reduction strategy and is underpinned by the Government.s decentralization policy. The project therefore contributes to Rwanda.s long term goal for decentralization and a realigned mandate for central government, through the empowerment and improved accountability of local governments and communities.  The short term objective is for the DCDP to scale out validated project experience in the country, particularly by extending the community-driven development (CDD) strategy of the precursor Community Reintegration and Development Project (a LIL),  from 11 to 39 Districts. The specific development objectives are to: (i) strengthen District capacity to lead a process of planning and consultation with local communities, translating their development priorities into sub-projects which are incorporated into Districts. strategic development plans; (ii) develop a matching grants system to finance the sub-projects; (iii) validate procedures for decentralized project cycle management and financial management, through implementing the sub-projects, to replicate as basic operating procedure in Rwanda.s overall decentralization program; and (iv) introduce and promote public awareness programs.</a><br />
