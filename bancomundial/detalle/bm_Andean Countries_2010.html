The specific objectives of the project, in support of this broad objective, are: a) the effective integration of the implications of glacier retreat into the regional and local planning in glacierized basins; b) the inclusion of glacier retreat impacts in local, sector development projects; and c) generation of data on glacier dynamics.</a><br />
