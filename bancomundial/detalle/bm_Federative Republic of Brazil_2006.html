The project, which complements other Bank-supported initiatives in the water sector including those in Northeastern states of Bahia and Cear√°, would help establish Federal and  State regulatory and institutional frameworks.  Once in place these changes would help formulate and implement efficient and sustainable water resources management policies and plans by: (i) strengthening relevant federal and state institutions; (ii) decentralizing water resources management to river basin committees and local water user associations (WUAs); (iii) developing mechanisms and institutional arrangements to promote efficient use of resource, allocation and enforcement of water use rights; and (iv) setting up a well-coordinated monitoring and evaluation system to track project performance and assessment of its impact on beneficiaries.  Provide reliable and sustainable access to water for domestic, municipal , and other uses in priority river basins in the Northeast, by: (i) supporting the construction and/or installation of storage/conveyance structures and distribution networks to optimize the storage, delivery, and use of  water supplies within selected areas with high concentration of poor rural households; and (ii) establishing sustainable administration, operation and maintenance (A, O&M) systems for water supply infrastructure, including sound and efficient cost-recovery mechanisms. Project-financed infrastructure investments in bulk water supply, by ensuring an increased year-round water supply for human consumption and productive purposes, would provide sustainable and reliable supplies of water to rural and semi-urban populations of the Northeast, and reduce the vulnerability of this region's economy, to cyclical and prolonged droughts. This would lead to significant improvements in the standards of living, health and sanitation of beneficiary populations, and would enhance local employment opportunities. With the creation of the National Water Agency (ANA) in December 2000, the project has also supported the consolidation of ANA and its institutional strengthening as one of its main objectives.</a><br />

The program will raise Brazil's sustainable economic growth potential, thus increasing employment and reducing poverty. In logistics, key actions will cut customs release times by 40 percent, cut container handling costs in ports by 10 percent, lower road transport costs by about 5 percent and increase non-road transportation by 10 percent. Improvements to the business environment will increase public-private partnership, increase cartel prosecutions by the competition authorities, halve the time to register a business in selected cities, and increase the speed of resolution and the recovery value of insolvent enterprises under the new bankruptcy law. Financial sector reforms will reduce bank overheads, increase financial access and reduce credit risk, accelerate the expansion of the insurance industry, and increase access to bank accounts from 95 million to 103 million people by the end of the program. In innovation, a new innovation law will increase technology transfer contracts between universities and the private sector by 20 percent and increase the private share in R&D by 10 percentage points.  Supported improvements in the Clean Development Mechanism will generate at least US$100 million in carbon credits.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">170000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P088543" target=_blank>The operation would support three pillars - fiscal management, public sector management, and private sector development - in two stages, with the initial disbursement made conditional on progress to date at the time of negotiations, and the second disbursement tied to clearly defined future goals in each area.   The benefits of the operation can be divided into three levels. At the first level, the operation brings benefits in terms of reinforcing the Fiscal Responsibility Law and Brazil#s system of fiscal federal checks and balances.  As discussed elsewhere in this document, this system has been fundamental to assuring Brazil#s national macroeconomic stability since the Real Plan, and by reinforcing the successful adjustment of Brazil#s second largest state, the operation has considerable significance at the national level. Second, within the state itself, the fiscal adjustment combined with improved economic performance will lead to poverty reduction both through higher incomes and through increased spending available for direct poverty-reducing spending, such as education, health, and basic local infrastructure. Work at the national level suggests that the elasticity of poverty with respect to economic growth in Brazil is about one, and Minas is unlikely to be a significant exception to this statistical regularity at the level of the country.  Furthermore, there is a 25% headcount ratio of poverty in the state.  This implies that a one percent increase in economic growth is likely to reduce poverty in Minas by about a quarter of a percentage point per year, or one percent every four years. Third, the improvements in the quality of public management in Minas will bring better service delivery to the poor.  Efforts such as results-based management and performance-based human resource management are key in this regard.</a><br />
