The SSPC II is expected to support social sector  policies with three broad goals in mind: (i) protecting the positive results  reached in the last decade in increasing access to and quality of health and  nutrition, education, water and sanitation, and social protection; (ii)  implementing the sectoral policy frameworks designed under the first phase  of this programmatic series to continue progress in social outcomes and  move closer to achieving a number of specific Millennium Development  Goals (MDGs) by 2015; and (iii) strengthening the capacity of both the  Government and civil society to monitor and evaluate policies, increasing  accountability and effectiveness. Implementing these policies will advance  achievement of specific MDGs by 2015.</a><br />
