Within the PDO, ‘capacity for water security and climate resiliency’ primarily includes improved water services, flood protection, and analytical capacity to understand and manage hydrological variability.</a><br />

A Parial Risk Guarantee (PRG)to support default risk and transmission risk for the Lake Turkana Wind Project (LTWP)PRG would guarantee $78 million  default and transmission risks for this private generation project.  With a proposed 300 MW generation, this would be the largest wind energy project in Sub-Saharan Africa.  The renewable energy generated by the project will be fed into Kenya's national grid and is expected to make up about 17% of the country's installed power supply in the first year of operation.</a><br />
