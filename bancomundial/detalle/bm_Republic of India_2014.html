The Department of Urban Development for the State of Gujarat mandated the Gujarat Urban Development Company, a wholly owned GoG special Purpose vehicle to prepare and Implement a Solid Waste Management Program to cater to the need of the 161 Municipalities in the State. GUDC has adopted a part of the Master Plan prepared earlier, and has refined it further with the objective of ensuring optimum and efficient utilization  of the  asset created under the program. Towards this end various strategies, and technologies are been adopted and assessed so as to ensure that the function of collecting, treating and disposing of waste in an environmentally sound manner. Currently technologies such as  composting of all biodegradable wastes and disposal of residues and inert wastes in engineered landfills have been adopted. Different forms of public private partnerships are also envisaged in the project from the perspective of sustainability. Realizing the importance of this issue, the Department of Urban Development of the Government of Gujarat has designated the Gujarat Urban Development Company Limited to administer, manage the municipal solid waste management project which includes the collection, transport, treatment and disposal.  The Master Plan envisages composting and other alternative energy recovery options for treatment of organics and land filling the inert as well as residual compost, in conformity with the MSW 2000 Rules. The MSW 2000 rules specify that any land filling of wastes to be done in fully engineered landfills and prohibit the land filling of organic wastes. The MSW 2000 Rules set out compliance criteria for door to door collection, segregation at source, transportation, processing and final disposal. The goal of these rules is to establish effective MSWM services to protect public health, natural resources and reduce waste generation, separate recyclable materials, and recover compost and energy. However, the rules also recognizes composting as an alternative technology for the processing the organic wastes. To date, the states are catching up on the compliance of the 2000 MSW rules, in particular with regard to the prohibition on landfill ling of organic wastes. The main reasons for the lack of implementation of the MSW 2000 rules are the viability gap for land filling and processing options (including composting), financial constraints of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), as well as limited capacity. Gujarat's Master Plan identifies the clear intent of GUDC to access carbon finance given the inherent difficulties in developing a compost market, and lack of public funds to finance the operations across the state.  Already in February 2006, GUDC discussed the feasibility of accessing carbon finance for the compost program with a World Bank team. In order to reduce costs, impact on the environment, GUDC intends to cluster the 130 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) in to 50 (Approximately) clusters for the purpose of land filling MSW in engineered/sanitary landfills according to the environmental and social selection criteria specified in the MSW 2000 Rules.  However, each ULB will have its own composting unit.  The wastes will be segregated into a wet fraction and a dry fraction with the wet biodegradable wastes being composted in vermi or microbial composting.  In accordance with the MSW Rules, the compost will be recovered for reuse and inert wastes from the compost process as well as segregated inert waste will be disposed of in a sanitary/engineered landfill. The project is envisaged to be developed in two phases to account for the level of preparedness of the municipalities across the state: Phase 1: This includes composting units for 130 existing ULBs where GUDC has been designated as a nodal agency to implement MSWM. The estimated waste quantity is approximately 1520tpd (based on the forecast of  2001 census</a><br />

The proposed Luhri Hydro Electric Project (LHEP) is located on the Sutlej River in the state of Himachal Pradesh and is planned as a run-of-river project, downstream of the under-construction 412 MW Rampur Hydropower Project (RHP).  The project with 775 MW rated capacity will generate some 3,152 million units (in a 90% hydrologically dependable year). The project will involve construction of an 86 m high concrete gravity dam (with gross reservoir capacity of 35 million cubic meter) near the village of Nirath from which 38.14 km long twin tunnels of 9 m diameter would bring water to an underground power house at the village of Marola, about 40 km downstream of the dam site. With a total potential of 150,000 MW, hydropower remains one of the critical options to address the energy/peak shortages and limit the carbon intensity of the power sector in India. Despite its critical role, the share of hydropower in India's installed capacity has been steadily declining over the past decades.  From 44 percent in 1970, this share has decreased to about 25 percent today, which is suboptimal to meet peak load requirements as well as system and frequency stability.  Hydropower development remains challenging for a number of reasons, including technical (e.g. geological surprises, sediment management); Social and environmental; Financial (capital-intensive, risky and long pay-back periods); and regulatory risk. These factors are expected to limit private sector participation in the medium term, despite efforts by the Government of India (GoI) and individual state governments to encourage private participation. Private companies which had shown a strong initial interest in the hydropower sector, have had mixed experience with developing and operating hydropower plants in India - Private ownership of the current installed hydro capacity is only 3.4 percent of the installed hydro power generation capacity, compared to 14 percent share  of the installed thermal power generation capacity. While exploring mechanisms to expand private participation in hydropower development, the GoI intends to strengthen the capacity of the public sector hydro companies to bring them to the level of top-performing public companies in the power sector. It envisages that the Bank's engagement in the hydropower sector in India will offer the opportunity to implement good technical, environmental and social practices, through a long-term partnership with a few developers in specific states in the Himalayan region. The Bank expects to leverage its support to the proposed LHEP, together with its ongoing support of the RHP in Himachal Pradesh, to help the State of Himachal Pradesh and SJVN Limited (SJVNL) take the lead in demonstrating effective project execution capacity and sustainable development of hydropower to the other hydro-endowed hill states of India. As part of project preparation, ESMAP is providing grant financing to undertake a study to understand the involvement and performance of the private sector in hydropower development in India so far and evaluate the challenges constraining the private sector to increasingly take on the challenge of the sustainable development of the country's hydropower potential. The grant will finance the following activities: (a) Review of the pipeline/shelf of awarded hydropower projects (with a capacity of at least 25 MW) with their key features and development milestone, in the identified Himalayan states in India. (b) Review of the key features of the existing commercial models (Memorandum of Understanding or competitive bidding etc.) being used in different states in the Himalayan region to develop the hydropower potential and what are the lessons learnt from the experience so far. (c) Review of the key features of the different schemes/approaches being used</a><br />
