Within this framework, it focuses on actions aimed at improving the business and investment climate, creating fiscal space for greater social investment and achieving key milestones in improving the fiduciary environment. Other key areas for growth identified in education, health and nutrition and rural economic infrastructure are supported within the CAS program through investment operations, which build on the ongoing portfolio of interventions in these areas. Future DPL operations are expected to maintain the focus on the growth agenda (trade, investment climate, public private partnerships, access to credit by SME), social sector financing, transparency and efficiency in public spending.</a><br />
