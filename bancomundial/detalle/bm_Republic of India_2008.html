The partnership would specifically provide a framework to enable individual or cluster of states in India to: -- Mainstream SLEM policy into their sustainable development priorities (e.g. PRSPs), thus strengthening the enabling environment for SLEM. --Promote synergies between the environment and other sectors of the rural economy. --Strengthen capacity for sustanable land management. --Adopt integrated SLEM practices, including water use efficiency, as part of development programs, and scale up viable, innovative and cost-effective practices. --Facilitate co-financing through a programmatic approach. --Reduce transaction costs where development partners (The Bank and UNDP) would use streamlined and harmonized project cycle procedures to develop and approve continuing interventions. The global environment objective of the SLEM Partneship Program is to maintain and restore globally significant ecosystem functions and services through enhanced local capacity to prevent further degradation, restoration of degraded areas, and dissemination, replication and scaling-up of successful SLEM practices within and across individual Indian states. The overall SLEM PP objective is to contribute to poverty alleviation in India by promoting enhanced efficiency of natural resource use, improved land and ecosystem productivity, and reduced vulnerability to extreme weather events (droughts, floods), including the effects of climate change. Specifically the Partnership is expected to support: --Preventing and/or controlling land degradation via restoration of degraded (agricultural and forested) lands and biomass cover in order to produce, harvest, and utilize biomass in ways that maximize productivity as well as carbon sequestration, biodiversity and  sustainable use of water resources. --Enhancing local capacity and institution building and strengthening for improved land and ecosystem management. --Facilitating knowledge dissemination and application of national and international good practices in SLEM within and across states. --Replicating and scaling-up successful land and ecosystem management practices and technologies that maximize synergies across the UN Conventions on Biological Diversity (CBD), Climate Change (FCCC), and Combating Desertification (CCD) conventions. It is expected that the SLEM CPP will significantly enhance local and global environmental benefits, sustainable development, and development assistance impact in India by providing: --Holistic, cross-sectoral interventions that bring together fragmented policies, institutions, and investments in a coordinated and sequenced manner, beginning with  capacity building and policy reforms followed by on-the-ground-investments, --Long-term financial commitment and a level of predictability in resource flows that allows for a more strategic approach, focusing on comprehensive actions, as well enhanced co-financing opportunities, --Reduced transaction costs associated with processing of small individual GEF projects with larger projects (because of the complicating and inherent project preparation and timing concerns, which often impedes task teams from actively developing a suitable portfolio of GEF projects), --An inclusive development assistance framework in which to make investments and share learning which will be open for new partners/states to join as appropriate.</a><br />

The process of manufacturing Gypcrete building panels is less energy intensive than the manufacturing of clay bricks and cements, leading to reduction in green house gas (GHG) emissions. The company Gypcrete Building India (P) Ltd. is setting up several plants in India. Since the project would result in GHG emission reductions, the company is in dialogue with the Bank to avail carbon finance for the project.</a><br />

The project introduces Solar Accelerated Curing System (SACS), developed by INSWAREB. These systems help to reduce 21-day curing to 36 hours with parallel strength development. This curing system is different from expensive-autoclave which is considered as an energy-guzzler.

The primary objective of this project is to improve the livelihoods of poor forest dependant communities by strengthening their access to and control over natural resources. The expected outcomes include 1) increased capacity of self-initiated community institutions to exercise their rights and responsibilities in forest management and decentralized planning; 2) coordination among service providers (state forest department, tribal institutions/local panchayats, NGOs, other line agencies) improves; 3) stakeholders acquire new roles, skills, and incentives to support, regulate, and monitor participatory forest management; 4) increased opportunities to access and market forest and non-forest products; and 5) expanded forest resources provide increasing returns (usufruct to communities and ecosystem services to society) over time.</a><br />
