These targets are part of Poland's commitment towards the EU in the context of the latter#s energy and climate change package.  Against the backdrop of tight fiscal constraints and the need to maintain economic growth and alleviate poverty, energy efficiency measures have been identified as the highest priority and least cost way to decrease airborne emissions.  Because of its large energy savings potential, the buildings sector will be the primary focus of measures to reduce energy use.  Biomass and wind power are expected to be the main sources of new renewable energy through 2020.</a><br />
