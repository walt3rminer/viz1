These areas are rooted in the governments near term priorities and medium term vision, and are critical for improving private sector confidence and reviving the economy. The PDOs include (i) Strengthened governance in the management of public assets and revenues through maintaining Ministry of Finance's control over all capital spending by abolishment of the off-budget development fund and asserting stronger budget control, enhancing transparency in privatization process, establishing proper accounting and improving operational performance in the energy sector, and maintaining financial sector stability; and  (ii) Safeguarding social spending by ensuring essential social protection spending, and re-establishing livelihoods and providing social compensation for the conflict-affected population and businesses. The reform program supported by ERSO has been  implemented satisfactorily and development objectives have been achieved. The ERSO is expected to be followedby a programmatic series of multi-year development policy operations provided the authorities stay the course on fiscal consolidation, ensure macroeconomic stability, and implement medium term structural reforms centering on governance and other relevant areas inline with an adequate medium term development strategy.</a><br />
