The main objectives are the achievement of average annual growth rates of 4.5-5.0 percent during 2002-05, the reduction of the poverty rate by half by 2005 compared to 2001, and the reduction of the unemployment rate from 18.1 percent in 2001 to 12-14 percent in 2005, while making substantial progress towards EU accession, which it is hoped will occur in 2007.  The medium-term program balances a strategy of private sector-led growth with reducing social exclusion and increasing empowerment to ensure wide participation in growth.  The program consists of five complementary pillars:  ·   Sustaining structural reforms in the enterprise sector with emphasis on completion of privatization and on the restructuring of the energy, railway, telecommunications, and water sectors; ·   Establishing a market-friendly business environment, focusing on reducing entry constraints, accelerating exits, securing deregulation and reducing regulatory costs, improving the delivery of public services to business, and improving the competitive environment, including through continuing labor market reform; ·   Deepening the financial sector, improving the legal framework for lending, completing banking reform, and developing financial markets; ·   Improving public sector governance, strengthening public administration capacity, improving service delivery, reducing corruption, strengthening accountability and transparency, strengthening public expenditure management, and increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the judicial system; ·   Investing in human capital and strengthening social programs, improving quality, access and efficiency in education and health, continuing pension reforms, increasing social assistance effectiveness, providing for better integration of the disabled and reducing institutionalization of children.</a><br />
