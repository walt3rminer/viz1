PEC is designed to  empower the school community, and promote school autonomy and accountability, e ncouraging parents, teachers and directors to design and carryout school improve ment plans that respond to the needs of the school and its students. The PEC awa rds a grant to finance the improvement plans in selected schools; these grants a re jointly financed by SEP and state governments. The program is open to all pub lic basic education schools that apply on a voluntarily basis, but priority is g iven to disadvantaged schools located in poor urban areas, as these schools have  the most need and also tend to benefit more from the program. The federal inves tment in the program leverages approximately half as much in state contributions  and in donations from local school communities, where schools mobilize parents,  municipal governments and private organizations to support their school improve ment plans.</a><br />

Project development objective:  (see Annex 1)  The project will contribute to reductions in local airborne pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions generated by the transport sector in the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City (MCMA). This will be sought through the development of the first surface mass transport corridor in Mexico City (Insurgentes Avenue) and associated traffic management measures.  The project is also intended to develop and demonstrate the catalytic use of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to foster technology, regulatory and institutional changes in the public transport sector.  It will also develop and implement tools required to measure and monitor greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions from the transport sector. While the operation of one single corridor does not result in large emission reductions, the project will help to develop the tools and procedures that may be applied, on a larger stage as a follow up to this operation. The availability of certified emission reductions is expected to accelerate this process.  Thus, the project will demonstrate that a high-quality bus corridor approach is a viable alternative for promoting a modal shift. In this context, the project will provide a valuable blueprint for other corridors in the city and elsewhere which could bring about a much higher overall impact.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">200510000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P079748" target=_blank>The objectives are to: (i) mainstream environmental concerns in key development agendas of four sectors (Tourism, Energy, Forestry and Water) as prioritized by the Government of Mexico; and (ii) improve the effectiveness and efficiency of local environmental management processes in Mexico.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">25000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P091695" target=_blank>The project will assist the Government of Mexico to develop the tools and instruments to induce local authorities to improve financial sustainability and efficiency of water supply and sanitation service provision in their jurisdiction. This will imply a shift toward "performance based" allocation of public (federal and state) transfers and concessional lending (via the Development Banks).</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">100000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P088732" target=_blank>The project development objective is to support the access of young rural sujeto agrarios with entrepreneurial potential to land and other productive assets within selected states, through the establishment of a beneficiary-driven, efficient land transaction model, while at the same time facilitating the access of senior landholders to social welfare schemes.  To achieve this, the project will support the GOM in piloting mechanisms that will: (i) on the one hand, allow landless young rural entrepreneurs to receive training and technical assistance, to acquire or rent underutilized and potentially more productive land, and implement productive and environmentally sustainable on- and off-farm investment projects that significantly increase their income and welfare, and (ii) on the other hand, help older ejiduturios or comuneros who transfer their lands to access social welfare schemes. Once these mechanisms have been successfully piloted and refined throughout project implementation, they will be scaled up to reach a broader group of beneficiaries in the social sector.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">250000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P089865" target=_blank>The Program seeks to support the Government's efforts to improve the competitiveness of the Mexican economy by strengthening the innovative capacity of the private sector, accelerating advanced human capital formation, and increasing the international integration of the innovation system. To achieve the program's development objectives, a first phase operation is proposed with two major lines of investment, in addition to supporting the policy framework for and internationalization of Mexico's innovation system. First, on the demand side, the program would increase support to business innovation; while, second, on the supply side the program would accelerate the formation of human capital (through strategic and coordinated use of the scholarship fund); and finally it would support the cohesion and effectiveness of Mexico's S,T& I system. Overall success of the program would be measured by the increase in private R&D from the current level of US$ 730 million (0.1% of GDP) to at least 0.2% of GDP, in the understanding that project interventions will leverage increased private sector R&D activity.  More specifically, and in addition to trigger indicators, the following improvements are expected:  (i) private investment into collaborative R&D centers, start-up of technology-based firms, and employment of R&D personal would increase from US$ 2 million per year to US$ 30 million per year; (ii) a sustained reform of the scholarship program would produce 30,000 graduates in areas with increased employability, of which a higher share will be employed in private enterprises;  and (iii) increased international visibility as measured by increase in co-authorships, an increase towards 1% of new global S&T knowledge, and increased international participation in cooperative research.</a><br />

THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT ARE TO REDUCE TRANSPORT COSTS, IMPROVE AIR QUALITY AND HELP ESTABLISH A CONSISTENT AND INTEGRATED TRANSPORT/AIR QUALITY POLICY FRAMEWORK IN THE MEXICO CITY METROPOLITAN AREA.</a><br />

The Project will support the expansion of the landfill gas facilities in Monterrey, where the methane from the landfill gas will be captured and used for electricity generation. The Project will also support a “proof of concept” solar energy supply to public schools in the Monterrey metropolitan area, State of Nuevo León.</a><br />
