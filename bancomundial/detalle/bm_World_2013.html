The aim of the exercise is to provide a comprehensive and easily accessible global databa se of civil society actors engaged in DRR. The target audience for the online platform is government officials, policy makers, donor s, development organizations, civil society practitioners, and other stakeholders engaged in DRR.     The key indicator of success  will be the creation of an estabilished online platform and sustainable tool that maps global CSO engagement in DRR.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P145948" target=_blank>The objectives of the research grant is outlined as follows: a. Gain evidence-based knowledge through research: As laid out in the strategic plan, GRSF and the Bank emphasizes the importance of Research and Development in helping LMICs with capacity development. Of particular interest is the development of data management system and evidence-based knowledgebase for road safety topics in the LMICs. It is expected that with the seed funding provided through the grant, the facility will foster regional-level research activities focused on the keys regions which involve on-going projects within the GRSF. Besides collecting surveillance data, the initiative will also focus on identifying interventions and research analyses in the local regions. b. Research topics aligned with the scope of GRSF activities : The scope of projects funded through the research grant will be expected to be aligned with the overall facility goals as described in the strategic plan document.  These goals follow from the five pillars of road safety as per The Decade Plan of Action created under the auspices of the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration (UNRSC). It will be highly expected that the topics of interest selected for the grant funded projects must involve a balanced mix of activities as represented by the five pillars described below: Pillar 1:  Road Safety Management: strengthening institutional and operational capacity to achieve national road safety objectives; supporting stronger governance and policing; Pillar 2:  Safer Roads and Mobility: improving the planning, design, construction and operation of road networks to ensure safety for all users; encouraging investment in sustainable modes of transport; Pillar 3:  Safer Vehicles: promoting crashworthiness and empowering consumers with safety information; accelerating introduction and use of proven safety technologies; Pillar 4:  Safer Road Users: putting vulnerable road users, like pedestrians and cyclists, first in policy development; promoting use of seat belts and crash helmets; tackling drink driving; setting and enforcing effective speed limits; improving driver training; Pillar 5:  Post-Crash Response: improving emergency response and trauma care; supporting rehabilitation and care of road injury victims, providing advice, support and legal redress for victims and their families; encouraging third party insurance schemes to finance rehabilitation c. Promote capacity development and dissemination of knowledge: One of the core programs of the facility during 2012-2015 is Capacity Building in the LMICs.  To facilitate this program, the facility and the Bank has developed its own appraisal tool for Road Safety Management Capacity Review.  The review guides the process of shifting from weak to strong institutional management capacity by working with client governments to identify systematic gaps and prioritize investment areas in order to build up activities which advance the development of the lead agency. In this context, one of the objectives for the grant initiative is to develop strong liaisons between the regional research community and the relevant stakeholders in the road safety environment.  The overall goal would be to engage in the development of the researchers so that they are well positioned to actively influence road safety initiatives and capacity building in their respective countries.  Through appropriate dissemination of knowledge to the local government and national agencies, the facility expects to leverage additional investment in road safety activity. The results from this research initiative follow from the objectives which will include the following: 1. Insight into the road safety management and capacity development issues in LMIC in the form of evidence-based knowledge 2. Fostering colloboration and interaction between researchers in regional academic institutes with the local stakeholders in road safety management.</a><br />
