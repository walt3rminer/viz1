Based on previous experience in the region, the project will select those technologies and approaches that have been proved valid elsewhere and try to adapt and replicate them in the other countries, according to the special needs and gaps of each one of them.Specifically, the proposed objective of this project is to generate tools and knowledge to enable governments to promote resilient management of their water resources through the inclusion of climate change impacts into policy, planning and on the ground investments on selected sectors, and to promote south-south learning, collaboration andtechnology transfer.</a><br />
