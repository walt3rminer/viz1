A DM grant will enable Biodiversity International to protect the livelihoods of some 200 vulnerable women farmers, by providing access to seeds for locally-adapted varieties of crops. The project draws from gene banks, indigenous know ledge and farmer know-how, as well as traditional ways of adapting to climate variability.</a><br />

The Program is being implemented in four stages (APL1-4).  The start up of each Program stage is based on the measured progress of implementation of components of each stage and the associated policy and institutional reforms, especially the readiness of the programs and contract awards for planned physical investments.  The main focus of the program is on: (a) construction and rehabilitation of key links to remove constraints to growth and access and expedite exploitation of the vast natural resources, integrate the country, provide access to marginal and drought prone areas and reduce transportation cost; (b) strengthening the road management and financing reform program to ensure sustainability; (c) developing the capacity and increasing the participation of domestic consultants and contractors in the implementation of road contracts; and (d) developing a network based approach and addressing social, environmental and development issues in a comprehensive manner.  Project development objective:  The objectives of the RSDP 2 Stage 2 (the Project) is to support the increase in road transport infrastructure and improve its reliability, strengthen the capacity for road construction, management and maintenance, and create conditions conducive to private sector participation in the road transport sector.
