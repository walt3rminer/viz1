There are an estimated 25,000 facilitators deployed throughout PNPM, with additional thousands working for donor, NGO and community empowerment projects across Indonesia. Phase 3 of the Community Facilitators Development Program was approved in July 2011 and has two main components: (i). A certification program for community facilitators, conducted by an independent Institute for Professional Certification of Community Facilitators (Lembaga Sertifikasi Profesi Fasilitator Pemberdayaan Masyarakat/LSP-FPM), which will employ Competency Assessors in a number of Competency Test Centers across the country, using national and international guidelines for professional certification; (ii) Continued development and refresher training to develop the core and advanced competencies of community facilitators and the development of a knowledge management system that will enable facilitators to form a community of practitioners and to continue to develop their capacities</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">2000000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P130048" target=_blank>The main objective of the proposed operation is to enhance the Government’s crisis preparedness to address the potential adverse impact of ongoing volatility in financial markets on Government’s ability to meet its gross fiscal financing needs from markets. Learning the lessons from the crisis of 1997/98 and more recently 2008/09, the Government would like to ensure that essential public expenditures are maintained and, if necessary, augmented to provide economic stimulus during this period of stress. Therefore, as part of its proactive response to the current global situation, the Government would like to put in place arrangements that would boost the confidence of international and domestic financial markets to enable the  Government to raise necessary resources from them. Thesearrangements include a set of confidence-boosting policy measures as well as back-up financing arrangements—a part of which is the proposed loan—that would be available in the event that the worsening of global financial markets prevents Indonesia from accessing financing at reasonable rates.</a><br />
