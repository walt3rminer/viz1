In particular, the operation aims to contribute to: (i) reducing inefficiencies in the electricity sector in order to support the Government#s effort to reduce the fiscal transfer to the electricity company (EDH); (ii) modernizing and strengthening public financial management to raise and use public resources in a more efficient and transparent manner; and (iii) strengthening and implementing the legal framework for public procurement to contribute to more transparent and cost-effective public expenditure.  By addressing weaknesses in public financial management, the operation is also expected to contribute to improvements to the PEFA indicators in the medium term.</a><br />

Key indicators for the project would be (i) total resources transferred to OCBs over the life of the project; (ii) change in access to basic services as a function of subprojects implemented by OCBs; (iii) cost-effectiveness of infrastructure investments, compared with traditional service delivery mechanisms, and (iv) cost-benefit of productive subprojects.</a><br />
