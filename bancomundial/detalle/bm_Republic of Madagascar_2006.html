<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">40000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P096102" target=_blank>In line with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Madagascar, a series of single tranche Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), provided in the form of budget support, is envisaged to support implementation of two of the three main axes of the PRSP: governance and providing human and material security.   PRSC 3 support to the strategic axis of governance aims at consolidating and deepening reforms commenced with PRSC 1 and PRSC 2. This includes assistance to the Government in continuing to implement its 2005 Priority Action Plan for public expenditure management reforms, and developing and implementing its 2006 Priority Action Plan.  These reforms include improving  the alignment of the 2006 budget to the priorities of the PRSP, the reform of the Treasury, the installation of a transitional integrated financial management system, taking steps to make the new procurement code operational, and the preparation of draft budget execution laws (Projet de loi de reglement).  Following the operationalization of the Anti-Corruption Agency (BIANCO), PRSC 3 deepens support for the Government#s anti-corruption agenda. It  also supports the implementation of a reform program for customs. PRSC 3 consolidates support to the strategic axis of providing human and material security, by supporting the Government Education for All Agenda and improving service delivery in nutrition, health and rural water supply.</a><br />
