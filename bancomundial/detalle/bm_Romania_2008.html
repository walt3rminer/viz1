Romania's Hidroelectrica is the first borrower from the facility for its ECSEE APL1 Lotru project.  Hidroelectrica and Romania's transmission system operator (TSO) Transelectrica are preparing new projects which in principle would be suitable for Bank financing under the ECSEE APL facility (alternatively, if required due to funding or timing considerations, they could be financed under regular investment loans). Hidroelectrica's proposed new project is the Tarnita pumped-storage hydro project.  A new feasibility study is being finalized.  A facility of about 1,000 MW is envisioned, in two phases of 500 MW each  The lower reservoir exists.  The project would develop the upper reservoir, tunnels and the pumped-storage hydro plant.  The Tarnita pumped-storage plant is a strategic system facility required to improve the operation of Romania's and the regional power system and therefore in principle eligible for the ECSEE APL facility.   Transelectrica will develop the required transmission system.  Participation by Hungary as a purchaser of system services is expected.</a><br />

The project will help to build a high quality pipeline of regional and rural projects at the local level through support to develop rural infrastructure projects, and bottom-up regional and territorial development iniatives such as LEADER+ and Local Economic Development (LED).</a><br />

The project would have a positive impact on the business climate by improving client services and reducing the burden of taxpayer compliance. It would also help Romania to meet its European Union accession obligations through increased revenue collection and improved administrative capacity.</a><br />
