THE PROJECT HAS FOUR COMPONENTS:  1) TRANSPORT SOURCE CONTROL; 2) CONTROL OF ROAD DUST FROM RESUSPENSION, CONSTRUCTION, ETC.; 3) AIR QUALITY MONITORING AND PUBLIC AWARENESS RAISING; AND 4) CAPACITY BUILDING.</a><br />

Following a sucessful demonstration, a larger-scale chiller replacement program would lead to the replacement of 30% of the remaining CFC chillers. It is expected that the demonstration effect of the project and the experience gained would lead to a more widespread use of energy efficient chillers in the chiller market as a whole. In addition to the market transformation benefits, the project would lead to a significant reduction in both greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and ODS. By replacing the CFC chillers with systems that are 30% more efficient, the CO2 emissions associated with air-conditioning can be reduced by the same amount.</a><br />
