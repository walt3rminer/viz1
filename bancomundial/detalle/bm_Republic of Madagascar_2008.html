The focus of the series is centered on: (i) governance and budget management reform and (ii) improved systems for service delivery in education, health, nutrition, water and sanitation.   PRSC-5 continues to support the Government to implement its comprehensive governance reform program.  A key priority is the consolidation of the reforms initiated under the first PRSC series (PRSC-1, 2 and 3) and under PRSC-4 mainly to further refine the regulatory and institutional governance framework which has been developed since 2003, to close existing gaps, and to improve impact of governance related activities.  Additional support will be given to governance reforms, in particular governance challenges in selected entities such as the revenue agencies and in sensitive sectors such as the forestry and the mining sectors. Reforms in these areas will provide an important test for the efficiency and effectiveness of the existing governance framework. Regarding basic service delivery, the objective is to accompany the process of institutional strengthening and quality improvements underway in the sectors.  More specifically, the PRSC-5 will complement the Bank's existing investment portfolio by reinforcing institutional rationalization and strengthening in nutrition and by supporting the implementation of sector-wide approaches in health, education and water supply.</a><br />
