The goal of this technical assistance program is to surface innovative non-state business models with evidence of social impact and to support their potential to be scale d through public or private service delivery channels. The program will do this through the following services:  1. Surface innovat ive business models and test their potential for improving results of service delivery to the poor through a competitive grant progr am    2. Support implementation and scale of these models through targeted capacity development, and broaden learning opportunitie s for Indian NSPs     3. Systematically collect evidence and data on their results and performance to better understand factors of  success and failure and increase their credibility.    4. Facilitate scale, replication and/or mainstream of these models by (i) identifying and addressing systemic constraints to NSPs and exiting those that are not competitive; and (ii) collaboration with WBG operations, impact investors, government schemes and/or corporate social responsibility programs.</a><br />
