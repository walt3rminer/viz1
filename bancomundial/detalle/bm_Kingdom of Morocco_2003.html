This will be achieved through: (a) a dynamic information and marketing campaign on efficiency opportunities among the stakeholders (industrial units, service and equipment suppliers, banks); (b) providing adequate technical expertise and (financial) risk sharing instruments to overcome the obstacles to investments; (c) upgrading of the supply of efficiency services aiming at fostering Energy Services Companies which will emege only with the perspective of a promisinig enough market; and (d) adequate financing mechanisms required when industrialists are unable to mobilize sufficient amounts out of their own resources. The second but indirect objective of the project is to contribute to the sustainable development of the industrial park by contributing to solving overall environmental and social problems. 04/17/02.
