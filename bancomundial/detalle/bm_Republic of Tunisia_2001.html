Board Schedule Comments 6/13/01.  The Borad date has slip ped from 10/2/01 to 11/29/01 .  The reason is that a post-appraisal  mission will be required in September to finalize some unresolved issues (outlined in the AM of the appraisal mission) and come to final agreements on policy conditionality. 9/28/01.  A joint WB/EC/ AfDB post-appraisal mission took place September 10-211, 2001.  The  mission completed the technical appraisal of the program and also agreed with the counterparts on strengthening certain key components of the program.  However, some issues are yet to be agreed upon by negotiations: The PHRD finances four studies in preparation of ECAL3.  The consultants have been selected for only two of these studies: the study of financial market development and strengthening of the capacity of the Financial Markets Board.  But even these two studies will at best begin in September.  The TOR for the debt management study h as been agreed upon and the consultant selection process will begin in August.  The TOR for the investment pr omotion study is yet to be finalized.  It is therefore highly unlikely that these studies could be completed before October 31, the closing date for the PHRD grant, or the effectiveness date.  Given that the action pla ns satisfactory to the Bank, as outcome of these studies are measures of second tranche, the team therefore p roposes that, on an exceptional basis, the PHRD is extended by a year.</a><br />

This goal will require good urban transport planning within the broader urban development framework; good coordination of all transport modes to maximize their cost effectiveness; a stable funding system to cover costs of public service obligations; improved quality of services at affordable costs through better management of public companies and subcontracting of some of their services to private transporters.  Phosphate railway transport Through marginal infrastructure development, deployment of modern telecommunications and signaling systems, and enhanced management capabilities, SNCFT is expected to provide the phosphate industry with better services and increase its profit margin, a key step toward its overall financial sustainability.</a><br />
