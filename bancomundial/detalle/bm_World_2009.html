THE PROJECT RATIONALE AND THE EXPECTED MEASURABLE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS: According to the IPCC, 'forestry' currently contributes 17.4 percent of global annual greenhouse gas emissions, mainly through deforestation and forest degradation in tropical developing countries, with a significant  proportion coming from burning or decomposition of tropical forests. These emissions amount to approximately 5.9 Gt CO2 annually, equivalent to the total annual CO2 emissions from the United States (Stern, 2008). Another comparison reveals that amount is often regarded as more than emissions from fossil-fueled transport systems. This makes deforestation (and forest degradation) the second leading anthropogenic cause of global warming. They account for over a third of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from developing countries. Although there remain divergent opinions as to how deforestation and forest degradation in tropical and subtropical countries should be included in any future climate regime, there is an emerging consensus that this issue must be effectively addressed. Currently, no regulatory instrument exists under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to compensate developing countries for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). However, negotiations were initiated at the thirteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (CoP 13) by adopting the Bali Action Plan. In the Bali Action Plan, Parties agreed to launch a comprehensive process to enable the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention through long-term cooperative action, now, up to and beyond 2012. The Bali Action Plan calls for consideration of policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries, and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries. Strategies for addressing climate change therefore need to include actions to reduce deforestation and forest degradation and to promote improved sustainable forest management. Concurrently with the UNFCCC negotiations, legislation under preparation in the United States regulating GHG emissions is exploring the possibility of instituting internal offset credits from activities such as REDD. Moreover, countries such as Norway and groups of countries such as the European Union have announced that they would provide significant financial incentives for countries successful in their REDD programs. This enabling project will contribute to building institutional and increased absorptive capacities in non-Annex I countries on REDD and its role in the wider agenda of sustainable forest management (SFM). By enabling these countries to engage in the new financing streams to be expected through REDD, there is an indirect contribution to the conservation and sustainable use of forest ecosystems, including non-timber forest products (NTFP). In addition, there will be an incentive for country governments to reengage in land use planning activities that will avoid conflictive land use decisions and hence jeopardize the ability to access sustainable financing for natural resources management, including SFM. The project consists of seven components: 1.   Understanding National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, including for the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Sector 2.   Detecting and tracking forest land cover changes 3.   National Forest Inventories 4.   Readiness for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) 5.   Reference Scenarios for REDD 6.   South-South knowledge and technology transfer 7.   Role of REDD in sustainable forest management Components 1 and 4 of the project will focus on building strategic-level capacity, addressing non-Annex I country needs to successfully engage in emerging REDD activities, specifically the understa</a><br />

The Project's main a im is to provide support to the core work of national education coalitions over a period of one year so that they can more fully eng age in the development of education sector programs with government and donors, and track the progress of national governments and l ocal donor groups in working towards the EFA goals.</a><br />
