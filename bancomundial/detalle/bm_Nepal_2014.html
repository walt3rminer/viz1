Activities funded through the project would increase the knowledge base about these important biodiversity areas, increase the capacity of government agencies and local communities to effectively manage the areas in the face of climate variability and change, and provide support to local communities to improve their livelihoods, thereby reducing some of the human pressure on natural resources and increasing the overall resilience of the natural systems.</a><br />
