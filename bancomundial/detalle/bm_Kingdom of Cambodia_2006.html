The IDA will work with the National Higher Education Commission and other interested parties to develop a proposal for a modest ($10-15 million) IDA investment in higher education (FY 02).  The investment would likely focus on development of quality control mechanisms, organizational improvements, staff development, and financing reforms.</a><br />
