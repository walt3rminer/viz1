<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">500000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P088181" target=_blank>The First Consolidation Support Program emphasizes three thematic pillars and four key principles of engagement. While the thematic pillars constitute the 'what' or substantive content of the results sought by the program, the principles of engagement attempt to address the 'how' or the political economy of achieving the results identified.   The three thematic pillars, as in previous programs, are service delivery for poverty reduction, good governance, and job creation. Gender and monitoring and evaluation have received special attention as cross-cutting issues.  The four key principles of engagement are : deepening the results orientation; fostering transparency and communications; building institutional capacity; and strengthening partnerships with donors.</a><br />
