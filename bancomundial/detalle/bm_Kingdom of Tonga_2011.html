Over the last four years, Tonga’s economy has been hit hard by a series of crises, which have caused the economy to contract, a significant fiscal gap to emerge, and poverty to increase sharply. At the same time, Tonga has made the transition to a more democratic political system. The operation provides the Bank with an opportunity to support key public sector and economic reforms at a critical juncture in Tonga’s development process. The policy areas theoperation will support are: (i) strengthening public financial management; (ii) strengthening fiscal policy; (iii) promoting structural reform; and (iv) improving social protection.</a><br />
