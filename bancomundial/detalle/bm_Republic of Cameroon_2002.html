These objectives support  the Government's Transport Sector Strategy and Policy, which calls for, among others, State divestiture of transport operations in  favor of greater private sector operation. The major indicators include: (i) increase in rail freight traffic to surpass previous l evels; (ii) increase in productivity; (iii) elimination of government transfers to the rail sector, except compensation for non comm ercial obligations (NCO), and transformation of net outflows to net inflows for the sector; and (iv) profitability of the concession  company.  As regards environmental, social and safety aspects, the major  performance indicators are: (a) control of logging and bush meat tra nsport, (b)cleaning worksites and prevention from further pollution, (c) improve transport and work safety.</a><br />
