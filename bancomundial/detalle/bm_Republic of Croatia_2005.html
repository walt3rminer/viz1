This will require fiscal adjustment, which is a theme running through the proposed operation, given the Croatia's fiscal position. The proposed PAL would also support the Government in its EU accession and integration efforts, and help ensure that key economic reforms under the acquis are effectively implemented and enforced.   The PAL series would specifically support:  Improvements in the investment climate by re-launching the privatization  or liquidation of state-owned enterprises, improving financial discipline of  enterprises, reducing the cost of doing business, and strengthening the  judiciary.  Efforts to improve governance by rationalizing and improving efficiency of  public administration, and improving public expenditure management.  Measures to enhance fiscal sustainability of sector programs by addressing  health financing, rationalizing social benefits, improving fiscal and social  sustainability of the pension system, and fiscal sustainability of railways  operations.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P071464" target=_blank>The objective of the proposed project is to help develop an economically and env ironmentally sustainable market for renewable energy resources in Croatia. Devel opment of this market will support Croatia in its EU accession efforts.  In addi tion, the project will help make Croatia?s economy less reliant on imported elec tricity and fossil fuels, reduce overall emissions, lead to a higher degree of l ocal equipment manufacturing, and create an attractive climate for private inves tment in renewable energy, and generate local industry and employment. The proje ct will in principle deal with both the production of electricity and heat from RER. However, most of the emphasis will be on electricity production (from wind farms and biomass fired cogeneration plants).</a><br />
