The PDO will be accomplished through a two pronged approach, namely, by actions to ensure vulnerable groups are more capable of exercising their rights and securing their interests through the instruments and procedures that govern land dealings, and by complementary actions that improve the capability of local authorities to provide more reliable and accessible information, and their responsiveness and accountability to local demands.</a><br />
