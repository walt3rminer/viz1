Financial sector program jointly supported by the WB and the AfDB  Board Schedule Comments Disbursement will be two tranche release. 3/16/12 BTO: The recently appointed Government decided to send back all draft laws to the Ministries to review their consistency with the new Constitution and the Government’s priorities. Many draft laws related to the financial sector* were sent back to Ministries and will need to be reviewed again by the General Secretariat of Government (SGG) and approved by the Council of Government before they can be examined by Parliament. As a result, two disbursement conditions (approval by the Council of Government of the draft laws on the capital market and insurance and pension authorities) were no longer met at the time of the mission. The mission insisted with Mr El Idrissi, Deputy Director of the Treasury (DTFE), (i) that compliance with these disbursement conditions should be ensured as soon as possible and (ii) that the adoption by Parliament of these two laws was important for the preparation of a new financial sector DPL. In a best case scenario, he expects these two texts to be approved by the Council of Government in the coming six to eight weeks. The revised timeline for a new Financial sector DPL (Board approval by end of 2012) was confirmed to Mr El Idrissi This code was folded into a new project ID (P147257).</a><br />
