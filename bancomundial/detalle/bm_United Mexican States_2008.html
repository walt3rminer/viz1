Project will reduce the impacts of extensive cattle grazing on ecosystems and   biodiversity, improving the livelihoods of landowners through the sale of carbon captured in reforestations, development of integrated environmental services products, payments for  environmental services, intensive livestock management and practical dissemination for replication. By the end of year 2, 73 landowners implementing reforestation plans will receive US $196,200 for the sale of 21,800 tons of sequestered carbon. 85 landowners of 13,800 hectares will receive US $393,673 in payments for environmental services. Five pilot ranching  operations will increase their incomes by an estimated 1,000%. The landowners of 15,200 ha of forests will eventually sell integrated environmental services.</a><br />
