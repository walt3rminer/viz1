Description: In recent years Uttarakhand has experienced rapid urbanization which has led to the rise of significant peri-urban a reas that, while classified as rural, are effectively urban in nature (in terms of density of population, the structure of the econo my, and aspirations of the people).  Improving water supply services in these peri-urban areas is a priority for the state as it is struggling with rapidly growing population and poor water supply services in these areas.  These peri-urban areas of cities, for exa mple Dehradun, Haridwar, Rishikesh, Roorkee, Haldwani, have very low coverage of about 30% to 40% household connections for water su pply. This project will incentivize the water supply service improvement program for such rapidly expanding peri-urban areas in Utta rakhand and also show the way for such challenging areas that are increasingly part of the landscape of India and other countries.</a><br />
