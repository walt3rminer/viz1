Its objective is to assist the Government of Cameroon in setting up and implementing a decentralized financing mechanism to ensure participatory community development in rural areas. It would (i) establish a system for channeling funds to rural communities to finance prioritized collective infrastructures, (ii) strengthen the capacity of communities and local governments to plan and manage their own development, and (iii) improve the legal and regulatory framework for decentralized rural development. Communities and communes would be engaged in a participatory appraisal of their needs, culminating in the implementation of subprojects cofinanced by the project. Efforts would be made to clarify procedures and build local governance capacity for communes so that resources and local development responsibilities could be transferred to them. Special efforts will be undertaken for enable marginalized people (indigenous communities, nomads, women, etc.) to participate in the project.</a><br />
