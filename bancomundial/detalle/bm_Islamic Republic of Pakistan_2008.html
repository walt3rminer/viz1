The Carbon Offset project will provide additional support for the achievement of the following objectives, namely: (a) develop hydropower potential in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner so as to help meet local electricity demand, (b) improve access of rural areas to modern electricity services, and (c) improve standards of living for the poor through provision of community level infrastructure.</a><br />

To achieve this, the project would focus on three areas:  prevention, preparedness and planning; and, response and containment.  Short-and long-term actions need to be taken in parallel, and efforts should be made to ensure that short-term responses are consistent with and contribute to proposed longer-term interventions. By concentrating the efforts on these, dual-use investments would generate benefits during normal times and in a pandemic. The project would finance activities under four components: (i) animal health, (ii) human health, (iii) public awareness and information, and (iv) implementation support, monitoring and evaluation. Even though the activities are organized by sectoral components, the project would promote and strongly endorse development and integration of integrated national plans that ensure common objectives across sectors for dealing with this issue. Preliminary estimates of project costs are in the range of $15-20m.  About $3m could come from the AHITF (maybe more if a specific country case can be made). The remainder could potentially come from the GPAI, but these funds would have to come from within the existing country IDA envelop - unless a specific country case can be made for additionality. As this initiative is regarded as an emergency operation, it was always assumed that the project should be prepared and appraised as soon as possible and that funding sources would be finalized in parallel - using a well prepared and appraised project as a vehicle to attract funding from wherever it is available</a><br />

Increase equitable access to quality education, through: ·   Materials development at the primary and middle school levels and improving classroom instruction for language, science and math teaching; ·   Teachers# professional development program and system of performance monitoring for primary, middle and (if possible) secondary school teachers; ·   Expansion of educational facilities and adopting measures to ensure sustainability of community schools to increase access in under-served areas, especially for girls in conservative areas; rehabilitation of existing government primary schools, community schools, middle and secondary schools; upgrading primary schools to middle level and middle schools to secondary level.  Options for ensuring sustainability of CS will include: (a) making the budget for CS part of the regular recurrent budget; or (b) enhancing the current endowment funds to a level that can generate sufficient income to meet the requirements of a CS; ·   Testing demand side interventions to bridge gender gaps and ensure access of disadvantaged groups to schooling, especially in conservative areas. 2.   Strengthen institutional development, through: ·   Strengthen the DOE at the Secretariat, Directorate, district levels and below for better supervision and support to schools, good governance, decentralized planning, management (including financial) and decision-making, and with an effective role for PTAs/SMCs# for better school management, student and teacher attendance; increasing involvement of women in management and administration functions; and staff development activities including in-country and foreign training, performance monitoring and motivational schemes; ·   Strengthen monitoring and evaluation (M&E) functions through upgrading EMIS facilities and GIS/School Mapping; establishing baselines and conducting evaluations; focus on completion rates and aligning indicators to the performance of teachers, supervisors and managers at all levels.</a><br />

Project activities are designed to recognize the importance of direct participation of water users and other stakeholders.  Key indicators include (i) increased surface water availability and reduced groundwater depletion, (ii) increased water productivity through a combination of engineering, management, and agricultural measures, and (iii) expanded local capacity and participation of farmers to implement similar schemes and formulate plans for sustainable water resources development and watershed management.</a><br />
