The power will be sold to SOMELEC in Mauritania, SENELEC in Senegal and EDM in Mali using the existing OMVS regional grid.  A PRG is required to guarantee gas payments to the procucer Tullow Oil estimated at $104m. Government of Mali needs to provide a counter-guarantee to cover the proportion of the energy that will be exported to EDM estimated at $17m (equivalent to IDA allocation of $4.25m given 1:4 leverage for IDA PRGs).</a><br />
