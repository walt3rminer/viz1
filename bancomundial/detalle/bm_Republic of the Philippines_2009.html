At the local level, the desired outcome is the reduction of sanitation-related disease and water pollution in six program sites  as a result of participating local governments making better sustainable sanitation investments and strengthening capacity in the implementation and management of sanitation projects through trial implementation. At the national level, the desired outcome is that the national government, led by the Departments of Health and Environment and Natural Resources, are able to translate the lessons from these pilots into national policy/program. The outputs expected are at least four sanitation infrastructure projects implemented by participating local governments within an overall local sanitation plan and program framework by 2010 and lessons learned documentation through seminars, toolkits and other materials.</a><br />

Specifically, under APL1, the project would (a) test and demonstrate viable business models that maximize leveraging of public resources with private investment fordecentralized electrification; (b) support transformation of ECs through institutional and operational improvements; and (c) avoid C02 emission through wider use of renewable energy.</a><br />

The objective of the project is to significantly raise household incomes and the quality of life of the people in the targeted Agrarian Reform Communities (ARCs) by improving their productive assets, rural infrastructure and access to key support services.  This would cover  about 80 new ARCs  wherein support would be provided through the following components:  (i) community development and capacity building; (ii) rural infrastructure; (iii) agriculture and enterprise development, (iv) ARCs access to financial services; (v) field implementation support; and, (vi) project management, monitoring and evaluation.</a><br />
