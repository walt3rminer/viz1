The success of the Project will be reflected in the overall increase access to, and utilization of, an effective package of malaria control interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality from malaria. Specifically, the Project would contribute to strengthen malaria control capacities to: (a) improve case management and treatment of malaria so that by year 2010, at least 60% of malaria of < 5 years old cases are treated adequately within 24 hours from onset of fever; and (b) expand prevention activities so that by 2010 at least 60% children under 5 year old and of pregnant women sleep under an ITN; and that at least 60% of pregnant women receive a prophylactic treatment.</a><br />
