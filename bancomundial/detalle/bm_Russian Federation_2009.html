The main components of applied technology include gas extraction wells, gas transportation pipes, condensate wells, blowers and flaring stack. Reductions of methane emissions will be achieved through flaring of captured landfill gas. The equipment that will be installed will have gas metering system recording gas quality and quantity in accordance with the UNFCCC verification criteria. JSC GPM will implement a day-to-day operations management process of the LFG collection and utilization system at the landfill. The equipment (LFG collection system) to be installed is expected to capture up to 75% of the landfill gas generated in the landfill. The estimated average ERU's per year during the crediting period (2008-2012) is 900,000 (flaring) tones CO2e.</a><br />

More specific objectives would be to support the development of: i) sustainable institutional capacity; ii) a framework for an inventory and registry of PEL; iii) practical methodological and regulatory tools for assessment, prioritization and addressing of PEL; iv) legal clarification of responsibility for PEL and its transfer; v) pilot investment operations in cleaning up high priority sites for which a variety of physical situations and financing mechanisms can be demonstrated. The expected outcomes would be (i) number of institutional, legal and regulatory documents dedicated to addressing PEL issues on the national basis; (ii) special financial instruments for dealing with PEL on the national, regional and local level; (iii) cleaned -up pilot sites of high priority PELs; (iv) reduced risks to the public health and ecosystem integrity.</a><br />
