This will be achieved through improving effectiveness of key EI sector institutions, supporting EI communities to be better able to monitor the delivery of community programs and services, empowering disadvantaged groups including women and youth in extractive industries affected areas, and improving accountability of the sector and for management and use of mining-related revenues. The primary target groups are the institutions involved in the mining sector, the communities in the vicinity of both large-scale and artisanal/small scale mining operations and the recipients and managers of mining benefits streams.</a><br />
