The ove rall Program purpose is: "vulnerability reduced and secure and  sustainable livelihoods achieved by targeted poor and vulnerable near-poor households and individuals nationwide". The Program development objective is: "target groups and individuals adopt improved livelihood strategies that build and maintain human, social, financial, physical, and natural capital while reducing vulnerability to shocks ". The development objective of this Project (Phase I of the 12-year Program) is: "an effective approach  to promoting improved, secure, and sustainable liveliho od strategies developed, demonstrated, and validated in selected areas,  and institutional capacity created so that these strategies can be replicated and scale-up in Phase II of the Program". The outputs that in combination will contribute to achieving the Project development objective are: (a) Pastoral risk management: an integrated strategy developed, piloted, and adopted in eight selected aimags (provinces) for managing covariant risk in livestock production, with a primary emphasis on risk preparedness. In combination with other project components, this component would aim to assist in addressing the underlying causes of vulnerability  to drought and dzud ('winter disasters'); (b) Micro-finance outreach: the ou treach of financially and institutionally sustainable micro-finance services to targeted poor and vulnerable non-poor households and individuals in rural areas of selected aimags achieved, including micro-credit and index-based livestock insurance; (c) Local initiatives fund: efficient, socially inclusive, and transparent community-driven mechanisms identified and established  to facilitate community prioritization, selection, co-financing, and execution of investments in basic infra structure and social services provision in rural areas, combining local resource mobilization with government grants based on clear and transparent criteria for inter-governmental transfers; and (d) Project management: a decentralized project management framework realized through the progress ive devolution of project management responsibilities to aimag and sum (rural district) levels within local g overnments, while retaining overall coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and fiduciary oversight at natio nal level.</a><br />
