<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">80000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P090829" target=_blank>The overall objective of this project, which is the second in a series of operations, is to continue deepening, broadening, and sustaining the reforms underway in the areas of public administration and fiscal management.  These reforms are at the core of the Government#s objective to build an accountable and effective state and are critical for poverty reduction to be effective.  This operation complements a series of IDA projects aiming at strengthening public finance management, raising fiduciary standards, and supporting public administration reform, which is critical also to ensure that a growing share of donors# assistance is channeled through the budget.    The operation also supports the implementation of reforms that lead to a more efficient allocation of fiscal resources in the areas of human development (health and education) and private sector development (investment climate, financial sector, and state-owned enterprises).  This operation complements separate investment and technical assistance operations in the areas of human and private sector development, with the combined set of operations seeking to achieve comprehensive sectoral reforms.</a><br />

The outcomes will be (i) the establishment of a framework for village level consultative decision making and representative local leadership as a basis for interaction within and between communities on the one hand, and with the administration and aid agencies on the other, and (ii) local level reconstruction, development, and capacity building which will lead to a decrease in poverty levels.</a><br />

This will be achieved by: (i) removing key transport bottlenecks that seriously hamper recovery, (ii) building capacity in management, implementation, and maintenance of transport services and works through the provision of equipment and technical assistance, and (iii) assisting in the establishment of an institutional and policy framework for the transport sector for sustainable service delivery. The removal of key transport bottlenecks will promote regional economic integration and facilitate trade, delivery of humanitarian aid, and reconstruction efforts in all sectors. Normal traffic operations on the key road arteries and in the air will be restored, also facilitating movements on the key import/export links and main corridors.</a><br />
