The proposed Project development objective is to improve the delivery of legal aid and promote the legal empowerment of benefici aries in selected provinces in the Northern Mountain Region.17. The principal outcome to the targeted key beneficiaries is that th ey will have increased knowledge of and access to legal aid for labor, family and land issues, supported by a system of trained, loc al actors such as legal aid providers and other key figures managing village life. Beneficiaries will have improved satisfaction and  trust towards legal aid services provided by provincial legal aid centers. Legal aid providers will be better equipped to work on k ey issues of civil, marriage and family law and will be trained on how to work with vulnerable groups, such as ethnic minority women , survivors of gender-based violence , and people with disabilities. 18. This will be achieved through:• Improved access to and u se of legal aid services  by addressing barriers of access to legal aid services related to diverse factors, such as cultural constr aints, gender, privacy, language and remoteness, and leverage traditional and local governance systems to address some of these cons traints.• Improved capacity of legal aid providers and other officials in substantive areas related to legal aid and cases identifi ed as priorities by local communities and WB national gender research, for example labor, family, and land issues, soft skills neede d to work with specific groups, and use of technology.• Piloting the creation of partnerships with NGOs and other professional orga nizations to improve the quality of legal aid services and demonstrate a more sustainable model for delivery of legal aid services. Overall, the direct beneficiaries of the project are people who fall under the targeted eligible categories of beneficiaries under the Legal Aid Law in Yen Bai and Dien Bien Provinces, which include poor, ethnic minorities living in areas with extremely harsh soc io-economic conditions, and people with disabilities and having financial difficulties. 19. The topic of focus – labor law, family , access to land, family law - are chosen because of demand and because there is evidence that these are particularly relevant for e nhancing social inclusion and decreasing existing gender inequalities. Thus, the choice of topics linked to targeting beneficiaries by vulnerability and gender. For example, according to recent research by the World Bank the provision for joint land titling in the  2003 Land Law has positive impact on the empowerment of women; the health and economic outcomes of individuals; households’ access to credit and; household expenditures. However, the country and its people do not reap these benefits in an optimal way. Although th ere has been a great increase in share of joint land titles, men remain more likely than women to hold a land title as an individual  or head of household. Key reasons for this that people are unaware of the opportunity to transform existing titles and the current implementation of the Land Law relies too narrowly on the individual to take initiative to convert singly titles. With more attentio n to this at local legal aid centers there is an opportunity to help increase demand for converting existing singly titles to joint ones. 20. The higher-level objective would be to contribute to improvement of legal aid activities in Vietnam by initially impleme nting the proposed activities as a pilot in two provinces in the Northern Mountain Region and then scale-up the experience of this p ilot in other provinces using financing from other sources.  Under the Legal Aid Law of Vietnam, legal aid services include particip ation in legal proceedings (litigation), legal advice and participation in non-litigation proceedings (e.g. petitions).  Given the n ature of the proposed activities, it is expected that the focus will be primarily on legal advice and participation in legal proceed ings.</a><br />
