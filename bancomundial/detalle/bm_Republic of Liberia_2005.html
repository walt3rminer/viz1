Specific objectives include: .to ensure effective park operations including enforcing park rules and regulations regarding encroachment on the park (hunting, farming, logging, mining, other); .to empower and motivate DWNP staff and locally recruited auxiliaries to realise the above as well as the following objectives; .to develop SNP as a site for research and eventually tourism; .to increase awareness of SNP stakeholders about the benefits and constraints the park represents; .to establish appropriate communication mechanisms for these stakeholders to contribute to decisions affecting the park and them. This includes inter-agency coordination and cooperation mechanisms within GoL as outlined in the draft environmental policy act; .to promote expansion of SNP and the Liberian protected area network, including forested corridors linking SNP to nearby new or proposed protected areas; .to promote sustainable development practices to communities and commercial operators around SNP in a legally secure buffer zone so their economic well-being is integrated with conservation concerns; and to explore long-term mechanisms to restore the financial autonomy of Liberian conservation efforts to the extent they were in pre-war times.</a><br />
