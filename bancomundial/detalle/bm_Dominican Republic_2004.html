<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">100000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P085433" target=_blank>There are two central objectives for the SCRAL.  The first is to support the Government's response to the social impacts of the current financial and economic crisis. The poorest are least able to withstand this sudden reduction in their real incomes, and least able to cope with rising food prices, utility prices and the prolonged blackouts affecting their homes and enterprises. The second objective of the loan is to stimulate continuing and overdue policy reforms in the social and electricity sectors, both of which are key to an effective crisis response and performing well below their potential. Social services in education, health and social assistance have long been inadequate to raise the social outcomes of the Dominican Republic on a par with other Latin American countries of similar per capita income. Social assistance programs in particular suffer from substantial structural deficiencies. The power sector is financially unsustainable, and burdened by excessive subsidies to better off consumers, low collection rates and weak supervision. These development objectives remain valid and achievable.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">12500000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P078838" target=_blank>The first project development objective (PDO) will consist of strengthening the institutional capacity of the monetary authorities to improve the design and implementation of monetary and fiscal policies. The FTAL will achieve this objective by helping the Central Bank to define a strategy to re-capitalize the Central Bank in view of the large quasi-fiscal deficit it is incurring as a result of the banking crisis management; by developing the monetary and financial regulations to be issued by the Monetary Board required by the recently approved LMF and; by helping the Ministry of Finance to implement an efficient debt management strategy. The second PDO will consist of strengthening the institutional capacity of the financial regulatory agencies to reduce risks and increase efficiency, transparency and accountability of financial activities. The FTAL will achieve this objective by strengthening the institutional capacity of the Banking, Securities, Insurance and Pension Superintendencies, with particular emphasis in the institutional development of the Superintendency of Banks and; by modernizing the financial infrastructure, particularly the country's payments and securities settlement systems. While the restructuring of the project did not contemplate changes in the project's development objectives, it has to be noted that the Superintendence of Insurance will not continue participating in the program, as the government has requested that the funds assigned to the Superintendence if Insurance be reassigned equally among the other implementing agencies.</a><br />
