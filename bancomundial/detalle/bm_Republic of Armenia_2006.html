To achieve these goals, three areas will be supported:  (i) prevention, (ii) preparedness and planning and (iii) response and containment.  Achieving these goals will contribute to diminishing the burden of disease and loss of productivity in Armenia, limiting the regional spread of HPAI, and enhancing economic and social prospects at the national, regional, and global levels.</a><br />
