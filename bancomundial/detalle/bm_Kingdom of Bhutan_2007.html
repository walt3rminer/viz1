These objectives will be achieved in three ways: (i) prevention; (ii) preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and containment.  If these goals are achieved, the proposed Project will reduce the burden of disease, the consequent economic losses, the risk of human infection and the loss of productivity attributable to human infections in Bhutan and limit the spread to other countries as well.</a><br />
