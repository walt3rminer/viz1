The ERSG is supporting a number of policy and institutional reforms to consolidate the progress made under the EERC and the ERC, to build the foundation for economic diversification, sustained growth and poverty reduction. The ERSG focuses on the following long-term development objectives:   # Improving public expenditure management and their impact on the poor;  # Reviving agriculture export sectors (coffee, tea and cotton) and ensure better revenue distribution sectors among actors; and  # Reviving the private sector by improving the investment climate, accelerating the divestiture of State enterprises; and settling the government domestic arrears to the private sector.</a><br />
