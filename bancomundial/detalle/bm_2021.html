The aim of the Pilot is to test new approaches and civilian implementation m odalities that should improve the socio-economic reintegration experience of former combatants. If the project is deemed successful,  the government will have at its disposal a set of social and economic support processes, and an implementation arrangement with sys tems and procedures that it can draw upon in the future. At the same time, would-be former combatants will have better prospects for  a viable return to civilian livelihoods, a clearer understanding of reintegration support they can expect, and a better understandi ng of how and by whom it will be delivered.</a><br />

The proposed project is expected to benefit 2,070,000 people directly (200,000 in Burkina Faso, 400,000 in Chad, 440,000 in Mali, 400,000 in Mauritania, 400,000 in Niger, and 230,000 in Senegal) whose livelihoods rely mainly on pastoral activities, including but not limited to livestock keeping or marketing. Target groups include women and youth, who will benefit from the project&rsquo;s overall activities and from activities specifically addressing their needs whenever possible. Secondary beneficiaries include service providers (both public and private), as well as national and regional institutions. CILSS will be a major institutional beneficiary of this project, alongside CRSA (Centre R&eacute;gional de Sant&eacute; Animale, the ECOWAS Regional Animal Health Center, based in Bamako) and other regional coordinating partners at the technical level. Under the harmonized approach of the Alliance Globale pour la R&eacute;silience (Global Alliance for Resilience, AGIR) partnership, the goals of PRAPS and other development partners are expected to align to strengthen coordination andmonitoring capacities within the Sahel.</a><br />
