The FY04-07 CAS envisages that over the four-year period of CAS implementation, there could be two multi tranche Development Policy Lending Operations or one multi tranche plus two single tranche DPOs to support CAS implementation.   This credit#s reform program and objectives aim to facilitate Zambia:   # To maintain and deepen Zambia#s macroeconomic framework conducive to robust growth; # To strengthen the credibility and institutional capacity of the public sector;  # To enhance Zambia#s growth opportunities while improving its poverty impact. In addition, the expected results of the Credit are embedded in the CAS for FY08-11 and contribute to its goals and objectives.  IDA and the Government of the Republic of Zambia agree that achieving these objectives in part depend on the implementation of specific reforms in the areas of:  (i) public sector management; (ii) macro economic management including the reduction of arrears and the establishment of a credit rating bureau; (iii) agriculture; (iv) infrastructure; and (v) business environment.</a><br />
