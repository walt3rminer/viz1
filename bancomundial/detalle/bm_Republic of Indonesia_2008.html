This new series under the new CPS follows on an earlier series (DPL1 through DPL4). DPL1 (US$ 300 million) was endorsed by the board in December 2004, DPL2 (US$ 400 million) in December 2005, DPL3 (US$ 600 million) in December 2006, and DPL4 (US$ 600 million) in December 2007.  It is anticipated that the new series will continue to be structured around consolidating and deepening policy reforms in the three critical areas covered by the first DPL series: (i) Investment Climate; (ii) Public Financial management & Anti-Corruption; and (iii) Service Delivery. The triggers in these three areas are based on the government's reform program and are underpinned by World Bank AAA. Because climate change has emerged as a top priority of the government, at the government's request, a set of triggers related to climate change may be added to DPL5(as a precursor to a possible stand-alone climate change DPL in a future year), if there are signs of momentum on that front within the time-frame of the DPL. Board Schedule Comments All previous DPLs have been disbursed at the end of each calendar year (which coincides with the Indonesian fiscal year). This loan will again be one of the largest in EAP since the financial crisis, and may thus warrant in itself full Board discussion.</a><br />

The project will assist the GoI to prepare and implement its geothermal sector reform program designed to remove the key policy and institutional barriers which presently prevent greater development of geothermal resources, and will assist in the transaction of geothermal power investments.    The global environment objective of the project is to promote on-grid electricity from geothermal sources, reducing the need for coal-based generation capacity and avoiding associated greenhouse gas emissions.   The proposed project is expected to have a sizable immediate impact as well as sustained log-term benefits.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">66000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P101905" target=_blank>This project has been dropped in SAP.  Diversification of agriculture in East Asia, particularly as a result of low food crop prices, and an emphasis on aspects of marketing and product quality is placing new demands on agriculture in Indonesia. In particular, smallholder based industries such as cocoa , coffee, and horticulture which have emerged in the last 15 years with very low technical or capital inputs, now face challenges of competition in a globalized marketplace. A shift away from traditional crops toward higher value crops with better income potential on very small farms requires support both from public and private research and extension services; better rural infrastructure; and new institutional mechanisms to create effective linkages between small farmers, modern food retailers, and downstream processing industries.  While the initiative for much of this change is already coming from the private sector, there remains a strong public policy role in areas such as trade policy, research and extension, infrastructure, price policy, and the creation of a supportive regulatory and investment climate. In Indonesia as in many developing countries, agribusiness and agro-industry activities have been hindered by long-standing constraints such as inadequate policies, weak institutions, inefficient marketing infrastructure and limited access to efficient agribusiness-related services. These problems have become an even greater challenge as globalization increasingly requires that countries modernize and strengthen their agro-food systems in order to stay competitive in the world market (not just in terms of product and process innovations but also in terms of organizational and marketing skills as well as the ability to meet increasingly demanding food safety and quality requirements). Many of these issues are becoming increasingly relevant for Indonesia. However, one of the key challenges facing Indonesian agro-exports is quality. Cocoa, palm oil, fruits and vegetables and a host of other agricultural products have encountered quality problems. At least 52 of Indonesia's agricultural products were banned from entering the Taiwanese market over a 12-month period. In 2001, there were 30 "holding order cases" in Australia for agriculture and processed food products from Indonesia. The U.S government has imposed "automatic detention" on Indonesian cocoa beans entering the country that costs Indonesian exporters $300 per ton, which along with the yield losses due to cocoa pod borer disease amount to a loss of about $300 million annually. Project Development Objective: The objective of the project is to strengthen the competitiveness of select agricultural export industries/production chains (cocoa, coffee horticulture) using a public-private partnership approach. The role of the government would be to facilitate interaction between different members of the industry and coordinate policy so that government incentives and investments in public goods such as agricultural research and extension, infrastructure investments support private initiatives that generate competitive advantage. Rationale for Ministry of Trade leadership of proposed project: A key issue underlying the quality problems related to agro-exports is the overlap in responsibilities and limited coherence between various regulatory agencies and Ministries. Another major challenge is the sustainability of functions, whether owing to lack of adequate staff, periodic or sustained budget constraints. Leadership of MOT in this project would serve two major objectives: (i) It would improve inter-Ministerial coordination for trade policy formulation so as to promote a "whole Government" approach; and (ii) serve as a demonstration of how the public and private sectors can collaborate to identify institutional and technical measures to reduce transaction costs of the private sector to meet broader public good objectives in selected industries.
