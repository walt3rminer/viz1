Russia has an extensive legacy of residual contamination from past industrial and state administered activities, resulting in perhaps the world's largest inventory of past environmental liabilities (PEL). The decline of industrial production and military activities in the 1990s left thousands of facilities and sites abandoned, many with high levels of contamination of soil and ground water.  Not only do these PEL pose a large and growing threat to the environment generally and human health in particular, they are also a potentially substantial impediment to economic growth. For example, the economic impacts from PEL include a mounting contingent liability against future public financial resources, land use conflicts and limitations on urban development, and added health mitigation costs. Given the extent of Russia's contaminated sites and infrastructure, future economic losses will be steep unless PEL are addressed. Adding to these challenges is the fact that Russia is approximately 20 years behind other industrialized nations in beginning to systematically address these legacies. The Government acknowledges the seriousness of this issue and is developing a national Program to address past environmental liabilities. On February 21, 2008, the Russian Federation issued a Government Decision to pursue the establishment of a legal and investment mechanism to address past damages to the environment resulting from economic activities under a Bank-supported project. More recently the Parliament (the State Duma) has approved federal budget provisions for this PEL project and an agency agreement among the Ministry of Finance (MoF), Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE), and the Executive Directorate of the Russian Pollution Abatement Facility has been signed, outlining the responsibilities of each party in the project's preparation. The project proposes to support Russia's efforts to address past environmental damages to environment by developing a national Program focusing on (i) establishing institutional responsibilities and capacities at the federal and sub-national level to address PEL, as well as (ii) strengthening the government's systems to address past environmental damages on a large scale. Success of the Program in meeting its main objectives will be measured by the following indicative outcome indicators: 1.   Improved legal and regulatory framework for implmentation of PELs; 2.   Established institutional capacity at the national and regional(oblast) level to address PEL.; and 3.   Technical and management capability to address PEL on a commercial basis. The proposed project will support the Government's Program which has three clusters of activities forming PEL Program implementation platform: 1.   Strategic and Institutional Framework to Identify and Address Priority PEL which aims to strengthen the operational and legal framework to identify, record, assess, and prioritize PEL. 2. Building Administrative and Management Capacity to Oversee and Invest in PEL with focus on developing the institutional and legal framework to ensure sustained PEL administrative and financial management capacity. 3.   Improving Technology Access and Efficiency for Implementing PEL Programs.   Support will be provided to develop a system to record and disseminate best practices in PEL management with the establishment of registries at national and regional levels. Project preparation will be completed in Q3 of FY11.</a><br />
