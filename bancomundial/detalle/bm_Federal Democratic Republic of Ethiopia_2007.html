Component 2 on the Health MDG Performance Facility Sub-Program to provide predictable financing for those critical inputs for primary health service delivery subprogram that cannot be efficiently financed at Woreda level through the block-grant supported under Component 1.   It will support four types of activities:  (i) procurement and distribution of critical health Commodities; (ii) Capacity building; and (iii) Strengthening of procurement and logistics.
