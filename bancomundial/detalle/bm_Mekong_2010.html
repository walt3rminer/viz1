This project would benefit greatly from infoDev#s Asia Business Incubation Network and infoDev#s global working group on women entrepreneurship. It is expected that this project would enable: o Increased competitiveness of women-owned enterprises; o Increased empowerment of women. Ultimately, the project should empower women entrepreneurs from the Mekong and as a consequence foster the creation and sustainability of businesses owned by women. It is expected to identify some success stories to be disseminated widely notably through the infodev.org and idisc.net websites.</a><br />
