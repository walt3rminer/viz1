The program has the overall objective to increase transport connectivity between neighboring countries in Central Asia along priority cross-border road links whilst supporting improvements in road operations and maintenance practices. The project development objective (PDO) of the First Phase of the Central Asia Road Links Program (CARs-1) is to increase transport connectivity between the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan along priority cross-border road links in Batken Oblast whilst supporting improvements in road operations and maintenance practices. The road sections to be financed under CARs-1 prioritize connectivity between the Osh and BatkenOblast in the Kyrgyz Republic and Sugd Oblast in Tajikistan as they build lateral spurs from the Osh-Isfana axis to the Tajik border.</a><br />
