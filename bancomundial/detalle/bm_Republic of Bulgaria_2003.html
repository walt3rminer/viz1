A complementary objective is to assist the government in preparing for the separation of central and municipal revenue collection functions as an integral part of the institutional rationalization and modernization process.    The project would achieve its developmental objective through a comprehensive program of reforms focused on:  1. maximizing community voluntary compliance,  2. increasing effectiveness and efficiency,  3. establishing a professional workforce, which will help reduce the opportunity and motivation for corruption,  4. improving equity and fairness in the administration of the tax and social contribution collection system, and  5. reducing the taxpayer/contributor compliance burden.</a><br />
