The operation would support this objective under three components aimed at: (i) implementing an effective and modern legal, regulatory and supervisory framework, in line with international standards, across the banking, insurance, and securities markets so as to improve financial intermediation and risk-taking behaviors, and foster a more efficient mobilization of savings; (ii) restructuring weak public financial institutions particularly in addressing their stock of non-performing assets, and streamlining their role and activities in the financial sector; and (iii) developing as needed the financial sector infrastructure in modernizing the payments system, improving the integrity of the financial sector through better anti-money laundering policies, and enhancing the quality of financial information in upgrading accounting and auditing standards.</a><br />
