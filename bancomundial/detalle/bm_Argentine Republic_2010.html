<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">200000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P120211" target=_blank>The PDO is to increase sustainable access to water supply and urban drainage services in the Norte Grande region of Argentina by providing investments in infrastructure and supporting institutional development.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">461000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P110599" target=_blank>The PDOs are to: (i) improve the stewardship role of the federal public health system, through the strengthening of Essential Public Health Functions; and (ii) increase the coverage and clinical governance  of Priority Public Health Programs</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">200000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P101421" target=_blank>The overarching development objectives for the proposed program are: (i) to reduce logistics costs for cargo shipped to and from the Port of Rosario by improving accesses to port facilities and increasing the railwayâs modal share in freight transport; and (ii) to improve the quality of life in the Metropolitan Area of Rosario by reducing traffic congestion and assigning the urban land released by the project (i.e. railway tracks, warehousing and maneuver facilities) to improve the quality of the urban environment.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P091659" target=_blank>The project objective is to promote improved ecosystem management in priority grassland areas shared by four Mercosur countries (Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Brazil).  None of these countries has adequate protected area or sustainable management plans for this highly threatened ecosystem, and all have endorsed this project to begin improving ecosystem management through sustainable use (primarily in grazing lands). The project will seek to: - develop local know-how, knowledge, and capacity to manage production landscapes without the further loss of biodiversity. - support demonstration projects focusing on grassland conservatoin with high replication value. - establish a transboundary coordination mechanism that will facilitate the mainstreaming of biodiversity within the grassland production systems of the region. LCC7 will lead this task in full collaboration with LC5 -- similar to how collaboration between the two CMUs takes place on the Guarani aquifer regional GEF project.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">30000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P116989" target=_blank>The proposed project development objective is to contribute to the reduction of road traffic injuries and fatalities in the Borrower's territory through the strengthening of the Borrower's institutional framework and management capacity for road safety and the reduction of road crashes in selected pilot corridors.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">50000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P113896" target=_blank>The project development objectives are to:  #  Improve the equity, quality and efficiency of health services, thereby supporting the reduction of child and maternal mortality, especially among those citizens with limited resources who rely heavily on public health services. The four health programs supported by the operation (detailed below) are conducive for these objectives.  # Improve the equity, quality and efficiency of education services in the first few years of schooling; thereby strengthen the human capital foundations of the province and improving equal opportunities in education.  The two education programs supported by the operation (detailed below) are conducive for these objectives.  #  Strengthen public sector management. The project aims to build institutional capacity in key line ministries and the finance ministry, introducing basic elements of performance-informed budgeting and policy planning, improving public resource management, and strengthening monitoring and evaluation of service delivery. The TA component is designed to support this objective.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">28000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P092840" target=_blank>The proposed project aims at promoting social inclusion by ensuring greater participation of poor and vulnerable groups in strategic planning and increasing responsiveness of public and private investment to their needs. Greater transparency and accountability in public expenditure management will help channel resources to the intended beneficiaries, who will help monitor and evaluate public spending, project results, ultimately helping promote greater social inclusion. Project implementation will make extensive use of consultations to give greater voice to the intended beneficiaries.</a><br />
