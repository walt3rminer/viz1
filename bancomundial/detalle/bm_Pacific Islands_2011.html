<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P128725" target=_blank>The overall project aims to support the development of regional knowledge management and institutional strengthening mechanisms in support of the Urban Agenda in the Pacific Islands. The creation of such mechanisms is anchored on the premise that both knowledge and institutional strengthening the urban sector are a key foundation for the development of an effective response and improved urban performance to the growing urbanisation challenges in the Pacific region. The specific objectives of this project are: -> Strengthening human and institutional capacities in the region through training of trainers (ToT) activities to support country up-scaling and regional replication of City Development Strategies (CDS) and Slum Upgrading Strategies (SUS) and other proven good urbanization practices; -> Developing a Pacific Regional Urban Knowledge Management Framework which coordinates the documentation of strategic planning experiences in the region integrating best practices and lesson learnt; -> Facilitating and institutionalizing urban policy dialogue into regional and national planning so as to establish consensus with stakeholders on urbanisation priorities, strengthen partnerships, and up-scale resource mobilization to achieve better urban outcomes; -> Strengthening monitoring by the Secretarial of the Pacific Community (SPC) as the identified regional responsible agency to monitor Pacific Islands' urban commitments made under the Pacific Urban Agenda.</a><br />
