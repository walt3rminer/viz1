In synergy with other development partners, the DPL will support the implementation of Gabon's PSFE program and EITI initiative. The DPL covers four policy areas: (1) forest; (2) biodiversity-environment; (3) fisheries; and (4) mining-oil. With regard to forest and biodiversity, the DPL will capitalize on the recent wave of reforms to ensure that they take hold and are deepened. With regard to fisheries, mining and oil, it will help open the door for similar reform process that is starting to emerge. It will support the implementation of the EITI in the oil and mining sector. This operation will help improve the investment climate by leveling the playing field and providing clear rules of the game in favor of more socially and environmentally responsible investors. By linking lending to the implementation of reforms, this operation will strengthen the voice of reformers within government and civil society, and increase their capacity to overcome inertia and resistance from vested interests. Using the Government's budget procedures, the proposed operation will also pilot reforms in financial management system.</a><br />
