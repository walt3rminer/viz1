The NSDSs/SMPs have been developed in all CIS countries except for Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. These documents highlight the necessity to upgrade the qualifications of the personnel both in National Statistical Offices (NSO) and relevant ministries and agencies as well as the qualifications of users of statistics at all levels by developing and utilizing a sound human resource framework and providing training to relevant staff in basic and advanced methodologies and techniques. Most CIS countries experience serious difficulties in strengthening the human resources within their statistical systems in general and upgrading the qualification of their staff in particular. So development capacity of CIS statistical systems is severely limited by the number of skilled staff. This development was caused by dissolution of soviet system of retraining and inability to create the new ones in these countries. There is some modest potential in this area in Russia, Ukraine and Republic of Kazakhstan. At the same time, a significant number of NSO staff, especially in regions, does not have neither statistical nor economic education. The major providers of training services in statistics on the post soviet field are Joint Vienna Institute (JVI) and International Statistical Institute, Tokyo (ISI). The JVI specializes on training for EU countries and former Soviet Union countries; the ISI deals with Asian countries, including the CIS Central Asia countries. In 90-s the NSO and respective government agencies employees from CIS countries actively participated in their training programs. However, at present the training programs earlier provided in Russian language are significantly scaled down although there is a strong demand in state statistical services of CIS countries for them. The CIS national statistical services are interested in receiving the training courses including in Russian language as far as the majority of their employees inclusive of younger generations are not that fluent in English. Moreover, after getting a strong professional upgrade and strengthening the language skill people in these countries leave often the state statistics thereby aggravating the problem of weak human capacities and inefficient investing in human capital.</a><br />
