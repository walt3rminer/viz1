The specific project objectives are: 1.     To empower five local authorities to address development challenges in Namibia through CDS; 2.     To strengthen the institutional capacity of ALAN so to become an effective service provider to its members; and to enhance its collaboration with the MRLGHRD; 3.     To mainstream gender-sensitive and pro-poor civic participation in five local authorities through CDS; and 4.    To gather and share CDS knowledge and experience across Namibia and the Region</a><br />
