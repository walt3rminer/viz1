The project will help China to participate in global efforts to mitigate climate change by reducing its HFC-23 emissions, and todeepen its participation in market mechanisms for ERs under the CDM during Kyoto's first commitment period (2008-12).2. The project will also assist China to create a legal, regulatory and institutional environment for utilizing a portion of carbon finance revenues generated by the project for implementing programs to generate sustainable development focused on climate change.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">100000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P070519" target=_blank>The objective of the project is to support sustainable peri-urban development in Fuzhou (as it expands to include Nantai Island) with the provision of strategic transport infrastructure and by strengthening the city's decision support system on land development and management.  Specifically, the project supports peri-urban development in Nantai Island with: (a) investments in transport access to Nantai Island (road and public transport); and (b) TA that would help the city to strengthen the manner in which the development is planned (to encourage development patterns that promote public transport while integrating environmental concerns upstream in the planning process), and the manner in which the development is implemented (to improve urban design, preservation of sensitive and historic neighborhoods, and to increase the city's capacity to phase and stage development in a market environment while increasing the quality and competitiveness of public transport).</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">200000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P084742" target=_blank>The overall development objectives of the project are to increase water and agricultural productivity in low and medium yield farm land areas; raise farmers' income and strengthen their competitive capacity under post-WTO conditions; and demonstrate and promote sustainable participatory rural water resources management and agro-ecological environmental management in the 3-H Basin.    Although it's objectives are similar to those of IAIL2, IAIL3 would focus more on raising productivity of land and water, rather than only production; and on enhancing the farmer income and the farmers' share of higher market values, rather than raising income solely through higher production.  And IAIL3 would add important innovations to modernize agriculture and enhance farmer competitive capacity.  The competitive challenges resulting from China's entry into the WTO are driving these changes.</a><br />
