<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P113860" target=_blank>The issue that this project addresses is the decline of tigers across their range, but specifically in Indochina.  Research to date indicates that the Nam Et-Phou Louey (NEPL) National Protected Area (NPA) and landscape in northern Laos is one of the most promising locations for the recovery of tiger and prey populations in Indochina.  Although tiger and prey numbers are depressed, there is ample habitat, a sufficient source population and the political will to recover this globally important tiger conservation landscape over the next decade.  To do so will require reducing the direct killing of tigers for trade and the overharvest of tiger prey for trade and susbistence.  The landscape design for reducing these threats is to secure a 3,000 sq km hunting-free protected area core zone for maintaining a breeding population of tigers and their prey while working with communties around the core zone to enhance natural resource management and governance.  This project is currently applying two management interventions - law enforcement and conservation outreach - in one half of the NPA to address these issues.  With support from the GEF, we will be able to continue and to expand these activities to include the entire protected area and also to introduce two new components - village wildlife management and wildlife-based ecotourism.  The expected benefits from the expanded conservation outreach component is that all communities around the NPA will be empowered to participate in, support and benefit from the improved land use zoning, protected area management and governance.  The anticipated benefits from the village wildlife management component will be the sustainable offtake of forest products by communities in the NPA management zone, which will contribute to diet diversity and food security, as well as develop a model for reducing human-wildlife confict. The expected benefits of the ecotourism component are sustainable financing for the protected area as well as income and economic incentives for local communities to support tiger conservation in the landscape.  With support from our matching funds, this project will continue to strengthen the capacity of the NPA to enforce conservation laws (patrolling for and prosecuting illegal hunters, controlling guns, rewarding informants, removing traps and illegal grazing areas) while monitoring trends in law enforcement and tiger and prey populations to measure the success of the interventions. We expect that this will result in conserving the Nam Et-Phou Louey ecosystem for the long term as a model for tiger landscape management in Asia.</a><br />
