This will be achieved through the implementation of cost-effective and clean technology investments that support model shifts, thus reduce traffic congestions, green house gas emissions, air pollution and improve service provision to citizens.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">170000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P120191" target=_blank>The objective is to support the construction of  a concentrated solar power plant and associated infrastructure in Upper Egypt.  The project comprises a 70-100 MW concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plant and associated infrastructure in Upper Egypt.  The Project was presented by Egypt as part of the MENA CSP Scale-up Clean technology Fund (CTF) investment plan that has received endoresement from CTF Trust Fund Commitee in December 2009.  The project is proposed to be implemented by the New and Renewable Energy Agency (NREA). 6/7/10.  At CMU's request and cleared with SM & TTL,  Board approval date advanced from 10/27/11 to 6/28/11.  The Government, in its letter of May 18, 2010, has requested for a Clean Technology Fund Loan of $100M. 6/15/10.  SM has agreed with CMU that this operation should be FY12 instead of FY11. 11/23, 2010.  The Board date has been changed to November 28, 2011 because of a delay in the feasibility study. (change requested by TTL. 12/1/10.  Minutes of the concept review mtg held on September 27, 2010, issued today.  The review discussed the risk ratings of the project and agreed to a rating of MI for preparation and implementation. The proposed ratings are somewhat more stringent than those proposed by the IL Risk Team on the account of having a project implementing agency which has no recent experience in preparing and implementing World Bank-financed projects. The risks will be reviewed during project preparation ad revised, if appropriate. The review agreed to process the project following track Track 2 ("regular lane"), with an appraisal decision to be made at the level of the Regional Operations Committee as required for all CTF supported projects. 3/31/11.  According to TTL, authorization to appraise slipped from 8/11/11 to 1/17/12 and Board approval from 11/28/11 to 4/26/12. The preparation of the feasibility study is delayed because of unrest in Egypt. 6/8/11.  According to SM, CCTF amount. 9/28/11.  Board approval date is likely to slip to FY13.  EIA funded through African Development Bank is unlikely to be ready for disclosure before end-April. Since this is category A project, Pelosi Amendments require 120 days disclosure before Board. 9/29/11.  We are now expecting delays due to factors outside of our control.  In particular, the ESIA financed by the AfDB has just been advertised for EOIs  last week (despite our attempts to push AfDB and NREA).  This means that the actual work may not start before late January and we are unlikely to have a disclosable ESIA before April.  This would make Board presentation very unlikely this FY as this a category A project (for which we as a rule try to meet the Pelosi amendment requirement of 120 days disclosure of ESIA before Board) but we should have CTF presentation and appraisal this FY.  Following CMU's response, Board approval date postponed from 4/26/12 to end-June 2012 (SAP does not allow any June forecast Board dates unless late FY12) with probability of delivery in FY/Qtr as C/C. 3/1/12.  Further delay on land allocation and ESA.  Change in leadership at counterpart (NREA). Probability of delivery in FY/Qtr remains C/C. 7/25/2012.   As the project is a "cushion project" for FY 13 delivery, the projected Board date is moved to Q1, FY 14 9/13/12. As requested by SM (P. Veevers-Carter) per EM dated 9/11/12. TTL changed from C. Govindarajalu (UPI# 105246) to R. Chavapricha (UPI# 199003) effective 9/11/12. 9/9/13. Likelihood of project being dropped is substantial, following political events and economic difficulties in Egypt. Appraisal could not take place in September 2013 as earlier planned. Team to allow new goverment and counterparts additional time to make a go or no-go decision on the project. Subject to government's decision, appraisal could take place in January 2014.</a><br />
