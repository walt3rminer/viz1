The development objective of the COMACO Landscape Project is to reduce emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) through the sustainable management within 270,698 ha of land traditionally devoted to community led agricultural and non-agricultural activities. The delivery of the ERs according to the delivery schedule agreed upon in the Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) is the results indicator that is being monitored by the World Bank over the ERPA duration.<br /><br />2. The project has the following specifictechnical objectives: (a) Agriculture Land Management including Agroforestry: to increase food production and household income by expanding legume-based agroforestry systems with demonstrated higher sustainable crop yields, and production of important firewood, materials and tradable carbon compared to thebaseline of traditional smallholder agriculture; (b) Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD): More specifically the Project will promote sustainable climate-smart agricultural practices in selected chiefdoms in the Eastern Province of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ). The adoption of sustainable agriculture practices will increase small-holder farmer crop yield, farmer income and welfare, reduce uncontrolled forest loss and degradation, which would be supported inthe short term by carbon revenues received from a significant increase in bio-carbon sequestration in agricultural areas and avoided emissions in forested areas.  To protect and expand areas under natural forest and conserve biodiversity through the intensification of food production on existing farm plots by adoption of legume-based agroforestry with in-built firewood production and avoidance of fallows, which will replace the need for further forest clearing as part of slash and burn agriculture, firewood and charcoal production. The decisions on land delineation for specific management purposes rest with the chiefs in consultation with the communities. Currently the challenge is one where allocation of forest areas for agricultural purposes to communities is made by the chief, and as a result the forested areas within the chiefdom are shrinking over time. Several chiefdoms have recognized the problemand are willing to set aside forest areas within chiefdoms for conservation use known as community conservation areas (CCAs). The interventions in CCAs will include land use planning, and preparation forest management plans by communities for managing conservation areas through implementing practices that will ensure that the forest areas are sustained. Agreements between chiefdoms and COMACOinclude provisions for implementation. The agreement also requires the Chiefs to submit a benefit sharing plan that will ensure fair distribution or usage of revenue channeled through the sale of Emission Reductions generated from the Project.</a><br />
