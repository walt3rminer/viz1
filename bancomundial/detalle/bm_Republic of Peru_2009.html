Within the scope of th EVDPL program, this second DPL is consisten with one of the key pillars of the 2006 CPS for Peru for FY06-FY11 (and the 2009 CPS Progress Report) laying out a strategy to support the GOP to achieve its goals of sustained economic growth.  The CPS recognized the need to raise the profile of environmental issues in Peru by enhancing environmental public investments and strengthening the institutional famework.  In support of CPS pillar I on economic growth, the ENVDP program will contribute to making growth environmentally sustainable by supporting the environmental legal and insitutional famework, biodiversity conservation, enhancing control over air and water pollution, improving the sustainability of the mining sector, and the sustianable management of fisheries resources.  In addition, by supporting the policy instruments of the newly created MINAM, the ENVDPL program would contribute  to the modernization of the state institutions (CPS pillar III).</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">10000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P112067" target=_blank>The objective is to contribute to the attainment of a defined reduction in fatalities and injuries due to road traffic crashes, through strengthening the institutional framework and management of road safety activities, together with targeted investment on defined pilot corridors in Peru.  This project will consist of preparation activities for a new road safety project in Peru that will assist the government to implement its National Road Safety Plan. The components are envisioned to include capacity building, institutional strengthening, and some infrastructure works to improve road safety. The project will employ a multi-sectoral approach and build upon government's efforts to develop a '2nd generation' road safety project; with involvement of various stakeholders (health, education, interior). Some of the immediate priorities identified are the development of advanced monitoring and evaluation systems, creation of regional safety committees, improved compliance mechanisms and fleet management studies. The project is expected to benefit from grant resources from the Global Road Safety Facility, through which, access will also be provided to innovative international initiatives such as iRAP, IRTAD and ITPN.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">330000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P101471" target=_blank>The proposed Environmental Development Policy Loan Program (ENVDPL) aims at supporting the government's efforts to strengthen environmental governance and institutions in Peru, and mainstream environmental sustainability in the development agenda of key sectors (mining, fisheries, and urban transport and energy). The ENVDPL promotes improvements in health particularly of the poor who are exposed to the highest risks from environmental degradation. The ENVDPL is consistent with one of the key pillars of the 2006 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Peru for FY07-FYI1 (and the 2009 CPS progress report) laying out a strategy to support the GoP to achieve its goals of sustained economic growth. The CPS recognizes the need to raise the profile of environmental issues in Peru by enhancing environmental public investments and strengthening the institutional framework.  In support of the CPS# pillar (i) on economic growth, the ENVDPL program will contribute to making growth environmentally sustainable by supporting the environmental legal and institutional framework, biodiversity conservation, enhancing control over air and water pollution, improving the sustainability of the mining sector and the sustainable management of fisheries resources. In addition, by supporting the policy instruments of the newly created Ministry of Environment (MINAM), the ENVDPL would contribute to the modernization of the state institutions (CPS pillar iii).</a><br />
