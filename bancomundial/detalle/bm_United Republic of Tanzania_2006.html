Component 1 of LGSP is designed to support the GoT Local Government Capital Development Grant System, inter alia through provision system of capital and capacity building grants for local government authorities (LGAs). This component aims to support (i) a sound intergovernmental fiscal framework and (ii) capacity-building so that LGAs can better meet their service-delivery obligations. Together with bilateral donors, the Project targets all 132 LGAs in the country. Component 2 of LGSP focuses on Dar es Salaam, supporting the upgrading of infrastructure and services in unplanned settlements, and improving local revenue collection and systems for operation and maintenance of infrastructure. Component 3 is designed to strengthen capacity in the Prime Minister#s Office - Regional Administration and Local Government (PMO-RALG) to perform monitoring, oversight and management functions with respect to the grants supported by Component 1.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">200000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P095509" target=_blank>The proposed operation would support the Government to pursue its policy objectives laid out in the MKUKUTA by providing financing for the execution of the governmentâs 2006/07 budget. It would also provide the incentives to implement key economic, social and institutional reforms to strengthen the overall performance of the economy and contribute to poverty alleviation. Over the period 2005-2010, it is expected that the reform program under the series of five annual PRSCs (PRSC-4 â PRSC-8) would help the government to sustain growth of around 6-8 percent annually, which is projected to result in a significant reduction in poverty. It would also help the government in making progress toward reaching the MDGs, namely, increase school enrollment and literacy rates, reduce child and maternal mortality, increase access to safe water, and strengthen the sustainability of development efforts.</a><br />

This will be achieved by improving the skills and systems to deliver judicial/legal services and public financial management, and strengthening the capacity of oversight and watchdog institutions (OWIs) to perform their role.</a><br />
