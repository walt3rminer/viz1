The Project seeks to actively promote and finance the establishment on abandoned pastures of forestry, agroforestry and sylvopastural systems (Table 1 ), including training and capacity building towards their sustainable management. To date, and after negotiation process with local stakeholders, a forest management plan has been agreed. This plan includes CDM reforestation project activities for a total of eligible land area of 11,352.9 ha, from this area 8,475 ha were considered for plantations in the project (see table 1 and 2). This is due to a) the discount of the land dedicated to firewood plantations and b) a further discount due to changes in landowners preferences. The project considers that this conservative approach is as an additional strategy to ensure the carbon potential expressed in the calculations. The project will be carried out in the sub-region of the valleys of San Nicolas, which is made up of 9 municipalities in the eastern part of the Province of Antioquia, Colombia, which cover 193,000 hectares, of which 72,000 will be used for the development of the project. The sub-region is the hydrographic basin of the rivers Negro and Nare, which supplies water for several hydroelectricity plants that are responsible for generating approximately 33% of the energy used in Colombia. This project formulates a Plan for Sustainable and Participatory Management that was drafted in the course of a consultation, during the last 20 months, with the communities of the region of San Nicolas, Antioquia. The project will be implemented by the Corporation MASBOSQUES, a public-private partnership integrated by the municipalities, the regional environmental authority, the landowners, the regional association of entrepreneurs (CEO) and two research institutions. It is aimed to ensure sustainable development in the region, combining production of timber and non-timber products and payments for environmental services (including carbon sequestration).

The specific objectives are to: (i) implement high quality Bus Rapid Transit Systems (BRTs) in selected cities; (ii) improve accessibility to the poor through fare integration  and; (iii) build greater institutional capacity at the national level to formulate urban transport policies and strategies (regulatory, operational, economic, environmental and social aspects), and at the local level for urban transport planning and traffic management.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P100738" target=_blank>The project development objective is to pilot the use of carbon sinks (through sylvopastoral and reforestation systems) to arrest the process of land degradation in the coastal plains of the country (focused on 2200 ha of the Caribbean Savannah ecosystem). This will be achieved through schemes that include: growing trees in pastures, introducing live fences, growing fodder banks, promote direct reforestation and secondary forest regeneration. The improved productivity will increase the storage of carbon both above- and below-ground.  The project also contributes to improvements in the quality of life of local impoverished Zenu indigenous population, and Afro-Colombian communities, through the labor and forest product revenues related to the reforestation program as well as a fraction of the of the carbon revenues as incentive for sustainable ecosystem management. The increase in carbon sink will not change the nature of the Savannah ecosystem. The reforestation will be implemented in traditional forest areas around the piedmont of the Andes. The BioCarbon Fund intends to purchase around 200,000 t CO2e in carbon sinks. A letter of intention has already been signed. A letter of no objection from the Designated National Authority has also been received. The project has also the endorsement of the BCF Committee and has been vetted by the Sector Manager for LCSEN.</a><br />
