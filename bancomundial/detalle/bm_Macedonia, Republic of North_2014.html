This&nbsp;was the second of two DPL operations aimed at strengthening key export-oriented economic sectors with strong potential for growth and employment. Building on the reforms supported by the first DPL (DPL1), the&nbsp; operation advances the competitiveness agenda in several important ways. It put more emphasis on reforms that can: incentivize greenfield investment and technology upgrading in manufacturing; promote agribusiness development through improved management of state-owned agricultural land; introduce a risk-based approach for inspections in international trade; and legal amendments that foster labor market flexibility and innovation capacity.</a><br />
