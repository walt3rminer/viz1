This objective would be met through (a)the consolidation of achievements made within 380,000 ha of forests under community management and 286,000 ha under biodiversity conservation and management in the regions of Tambacouda and Kolda and the extension in 350,000 ha of new zones in the regions of Kaolack and Matam; (b) the promotion of interfuels substitution options and improved stoves; (c)the establishment of Jatropha plantation by communities for biodiesel production; and (d)institutional strengthening in the household energy subsector. The project would have two main components: Sustainable Woodfuels Supply Management; and Demand Management and Inter-fuel Substitution Options. This phase II will sustain in previous zones and expand in new zones a permanent system capable of producing 60,000 tons of charcoal per year on a sustainable basis; reduce woodfuels related deforestation and CO2 emissions; and generate more than US $30,000 per year in direct revenues to participating villages.</a><br />
