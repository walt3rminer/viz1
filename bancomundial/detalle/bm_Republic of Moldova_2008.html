<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P112908" target=_blank>The proposed Project will be an integral part of a larger and longer-term program of the Government to improve the effectiveness of health and social assistance systems in Moldova.  In addition to the proposed IDA credit, several donors including IDA, EU, SIDA, DfID, CEB and relevant UN agencies, will through coordinated but parallel financed operations, support the Government initiatives in this area.  The primary objective of the project is to support the Government?s program to increase access to quality and efficient health and improve efficiency of social assistance services for the Moldovan population in line with the MTEF for 2007-09.  If the project is successful, Moldova will in the long term, (a) decrease pre-mature mortality and disability closing the gap between European Union and Moldova through upgraded health services, increased financial protection and increased efficiency of health system; and (b) be able to increase social assistance coverage among the needy, and decrease leakages.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">6000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P110421" target=_blank>The project is the second Phase of a two-phase Rural Investment and Services Program. The Program objective, which remains unchanged, is to provide long-term support to accelerate agricultural recovery and growth so that Moldovaâs agricultural and rural sectors can play their full role in providing the underpinnings for future income growth and poverty reduction.   Under this overarching objective, the project will strive to continue foster the post-privatization growth in the agricultural and rural sectors of Moldova by improving access of farmers and rural entrepreneurs to legal ownership status, know-how, knowledge and financial services, while building the capacity of the private and public institutions to ensure the sustainability of the activities.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">10000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P103941" target=_blank>PRSC 2, the second in a set of three annual PRSCs, support the Government#s reform efforts as articulated in their PRSP (or National Development Strategy NDS as it is known in Moldova) and the EU-Moldova Action Plan. The Second Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC2) for the Republic of Moldova is intended to bolster and deepen the reform efforts supported by the first PRSC (PRSC1). The proposed credit aims to support Government#s efforts to accelerate shared economic growth and improve governance by addressing the efficiency of its expenditure programs and public administration # key elements in poverty reduction. To this end, the proposed PRSC2 will continue to support selective areas of the Government#s reform agenda, as outlined in the National Development Plan (NDS) # the successor to the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP) # and the European Union (EU)-Moldova action plan. The proposed PRSC2 also complements and reinforces other Bank Group programs in Moldova, the International Monetary Fund (IMF)-supported Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) and other donor activities. The PRSC2 will support the Government#s objectives of:   # Improving the Investment Climate: The Government#s reform agenda focuses on further improving the investment climate for private sector development. These efforts will also directly contribute to Government efforts to improve governance and reduce corruption. An important element of Moldova#s efforts to accelerate economic growth and poverty reduction will be improving the performance of the agriculture sector. Similarly, reducing destabilizing economic impacts of external energy price shocks will require improvements in energy efficiency. # Improving the Efficiency and Management of Public Resources: Advancing reforms that establish a modern and efficient public administration is necessary in order to achieve the country#s longer-term development outcomes. Increased public investment spending, particularly in public infrastructure, will be needed in order to support Moldova#s private-sector led growth. This will require enhancing the strategic allocation of public resources by improving the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) process, public procurement practices and including better public investment management. Reforms in a number of key sectoral areas can also improve the efficiency of public resource use, allowing for spending reallocation towards public investment. # Strengthening Pension and Social Assistance Systems. The second PRSC would support the Government#s efforts to strengthen the effectiveness and future fiscal viability of the pay-as-you-go pension program by supporting efforts to complete the 1999 pension reform, including efforts to unify the pension system for all types of pensioners. With higher energy and food prices likely to persist for some time to come, improving targeting efficiency of social assistance programs and gaining efficiency in program administration will be necessary elements of Moldova#s poverty reduction efforts.</a><br />
