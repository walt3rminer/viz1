The long-term goal of t he RPT project is to contribute to poverty reduction in the region by assisting the NBI countries in developing the tools for improving access to reliable, low cost, sustainably generated power.  Facilitating the development of a regional e lectricity market can play a key role in fostering cooperation among Nile Basin states and in ensuring that the resources of the Nile Basin are developed and ma naged in an integrated and environmentally sustainable manner.</a><br />
