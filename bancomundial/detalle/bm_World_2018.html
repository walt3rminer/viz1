EBRD have recently identified T ajikistan as a potential focus country where EBRD have been stepping up their activities related to road safety and occupational roa d risk.  EBRD may therefore use Tajikistan as one of the focal countries to ensure whatever tools are developed are suitable for bus inesses --and transferable to other Low/Low- Middle Income countries. However, the this may be expanded to other countries and will be determined. The project is global in nature.</a><br />
