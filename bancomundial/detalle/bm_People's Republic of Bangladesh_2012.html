<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">125000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P119363" target=_blank>The objective is to increase the incomes of fisheries communities and the availability of fish products for domestic consumption and local sale through improved fishing productivity, product quality, and market access.  The overall development goal of the Integrated Inland Fisheries Livelihood Project would be to broaden the livelihoods and increase the incomes of poor landless households and marginal farmers through increased production of fish; and by improving the market availability of fish at accessible prices for consumers, increase food security and nutritional status of these groups. At this preliminary stage, it is envisioned that a new project would have the following components: 1.   Production Improvement This component would improve sustainable management and productivity of inland capture fisheries, inland freshwater aquaculture, coastal (shrimp) aquaculture, and to a limited degree, coastal marine fishing. For inland capture fisheries, the project would build on the knowledge and experience gained from the Fourth Fisheries Project by further developing and scaling up 1,200 community-based fisheries management organizations in inland capture fisheries, covering over 500,000 ha of water area. Specific activities would include promoting better local control of capture fishing; piloting innovative approaches for improving productivity such as fish sanctuaries and cage fish culture; addressing critical habitat restoration; and increasing the use of improved stock. For inland freshwater aquaculture, the project would consolidate 500 existing community/cooperative inland freshwater fisheries systems, and establish 700 new community-based systems across 500,000 ha of seasonal pond areas; demonstrate and scale up high-yield pond production models, including more integrated aquaculture techniques. For coastal aquaculture, the project would support training activities to promote more efficient shrimp aquaculture practices and quality control, particularly for smaller producers; and demonstrate and scale up more intensive shrimp farming technologies. For coastal marine fisheries, the project would provide modest support to improve sustainable fisheries management through establishment of a register of fishers and vessels; enhance ongoing efforts to develop updated stock assessments, and provide technical assistance for initial bio-economic modeling of resource rents for key marine fisheries. 2.   Institutional Development This component will improve the capability of the Department of Fisheries to deliver more effective services in key functional areas in support of sector development, based on the 1996 National Fisheries Policy and the 2006 National Fisheries Strategy. Specific national-level activities would include (a) assisting in the further development and implementation of the Fisheries Resources Management Act and supporting regulatory framework, particularly around leasing of inland waters; (b) strengthening the human resource capacity and operation of the Department of Fisheries, its partners and primary stakeholders, to ensure  more effective service delivery in key functional areas; (c) establish and support new monitoring and evaluation systems, and improved coordination; (d) strengthen national fisheries research and development to provide relevant information to a range of stakeholders in support of improved management and production; (e) strengthen capacities for more effective environmental assessment services in support of fisheries sector development; and (f) assist in establishing fisheries management information systems which would underpin more effective planning,  management and regulatory control of fisheries resources. At the field level, the project would build capacities and strengthen institutions in more than 2,400 communities involved with inland capture, inland freshwater aquaculture, and coastal shrimp aquaculture to facilitate improved production, market access, technology transfer, and exte</a><br />

The project development objective is to help the Government of Bangladesh enhance long-term water resources planning and development to mitigate against extreme water-related risks while improving economic benefits to stakeholders.  The PDO will be achieved trough the following key performance indicators: 1.   Operationalization of modern tools and instruments to boost state-of-the-art knowledge on  water planning and development and mitigation of extreme water hazards; 2.   Significant socio-economic benefits to stakeholders and the environment resulting from the effective rehabilitation of the Gorai river system and its associated ecosystems; 3.   Effective synergies among water institutions demonstrated by reliability of data collection and coordination mechanisms dedicated to responding to extreme water events.</a><br />
