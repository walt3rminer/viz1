The CDM Project will generate bagasse-based electricity for internal use as well as for sale to the Berbice regional grid, displacing the use of light fuel oil in diesel engine-driven generators operated by the Guyana Power and Light Company (GPL). As the utility currently has insufficient capacity, there is extensive use of self-generation by industry and households. The project thus has the potential to displace a significant amount of this unregulated and inefficient self-generation as confidence in reliable supply is progressively built over time.</a><br />
