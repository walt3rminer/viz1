A key priority is the consolidation of the reforms initiated under the first PRSC series (PRSC-1, 2 and 3) and under PRSC-4 mainly to further refine the regulatory and institutional governance framework which has been developed since 2003, to close existing gaps, and to improve impact of governance related activities.  Additional support will be given to governance reforms, in particular governance challenges in selected entities such as the revenue agencies and in sensitive sectors such as the forestry and the mining sectors. Reforms in these areas will provide an important test for the efficiency and effectiveness of the existing governance framework. Regarding basic service delivery, the objective is to accompany the process of institutional strengthening and quality improvements underway in the sectors.  More specifically, the PRSC-5 will complement the Bank's existing investment portfolio by reinforcing institutional rationalization and strengthening in nutrition and by supporting the implementation of sector-wide approaches in health, education and water supply.</a><br />

The objectives supported by the PRSO IV remained valid and were not altered.  The Supplemental Credit provided additional budgetary support to the Government to help efforts to sustain implementation efforts of the PRSO program in the face of unanticipated budget financing needs associated with the August 2008 conflict, including the needs of internally displaced people (IDPs) and other conflict-affected people, repairing and rehabilitating of damaged infrastructure, and initiating an economic recovery program [see Georgia: Joint Needs Assessment Report, October 2008, the World Bank and the UN with the participation of ADB, EC, EBRD, EIB, and IFC].</a><br />
