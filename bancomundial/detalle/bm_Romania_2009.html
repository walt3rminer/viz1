Specifically, these reforms aim to (i) strengthen public expenditure management which has been a key weakness that contributed to the buildup of Romania's vulnerability to the financial crisis; (ii) cushion the impact of the crisis on the poor and vulnerable; and (iii) minimize risks of a domestic financial sector crisis by addressing current and potential vulnerabilities as well as strengthening regulation and supervision for a more resilient and well functioning financial sector in longer-term. The ultimate objective is to support the Government's efforts to emerge from the crisis on a stronger footing, so as to be able to resume and sustain high growth and convergence to the living standards of other more advanced EU economies.</a><br />
