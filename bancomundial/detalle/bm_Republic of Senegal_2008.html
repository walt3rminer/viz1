<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">80000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P105279" target=_blank>The primary objective of the operation is to ensure a sound and sustained long-term development of electricity services and supply of petroleum products for Senegal, and therefore to support the achievement of the Government#s macroeconomic objectives.   To achieve such objective, the operation comprises: (a) measures to allow SENELEC to restore its financial equilibrium and to meet standard financial ratios by end CY2009; (b) policy measures aimed at ensuring that the electricity sub-sector and the downstream hydrocarbon sub-sector, which provides essential inputs to the electricity sub-sector,  operate in an efficient, transparent and financially sustainable way with adequate governance and financial arrangements; and (c) measures to ensure a sustainable long term development of Senegal#s energy sector.  The operation complements the efforts made by the Government and by other donors with respect to budgetary support to SENELEC and SAR, investment financing, and policy reform and capacity strengthening.  It also constitutes an effective vehicle to deepen the dialogue and harmonize Government and donors strategies in the energy sector.</a><br />
