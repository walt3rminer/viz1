Country and sector issues  Poverty in Burundi. Burundi has a population of about 6.8 million in a small geographic area; the population density, 240 persons per square kilometer, is the highest in Africa. Burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world, with per capita GNP of only US$110 (2001). Between 1993 and 2000 the poverty level in rural areas, where 90 percent of Burundi?s people live, rose from 25 percent to 45 percent and the poverty level in urban areas rose from 33 percent to about 65 percent. Moreover, between 1992 and 2000, per capital income decreased 5 percent annually, mainly because many farms are located   in areas where access to agricultural inputs and markets is difficult, crops and cattle have been pillaged, market prices have fallen, employment in the urban private sector has fallen off, and inflation  has risen. Low agricultural production. Burundi has substantial agricultural potential, with adequate rainfall and good soils. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, employing more than 90 percent of the active population and accounting for 50 percent of GDP and over 80 percent of export earnings. Agricultural production is subsistence-oriented except for the cash crops (coffee, tea, rice, sugar, and cotton) that are oriented toward export markets. Traditionally, Burundi has been self-sufficient in food production, but during the civil crisis in the 1990s, production did not keep pace with population growth. During the crisis, looting and destruction of household goods and livestock deprived farmers of their most important possessions, at the same time that distribution and marketing channels for agricultural inputs and products collapsed.  The  Government?s Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy identified  the followingissues  related to sustainable growth in the agricultural sector  (see Annex 1): -  Low farm productivity, - Inadequate agricultural research and extension services, - Excessive focus on the coffee and cotton subsectors,  -  Poor access to agricultural inputs and rural finance, and  -  Degradation of natural resources.  The economic collapse and the discontinuation of many public services in Burundi have caused widespread suffering and severely restricted agricultural development. In rural areas, health services have declined by 36 percent at the same time that HIV/AIDS has continued to spread.  In 2001 the overall infection rate reached 7.4 percent (20 percent in urban areas), maternal mortality rates have increased, and only 48 percent of the population has access to potable water. The Ministry of Agriculture has limited capacity to design, implement, and monitor rural development policies and projects. Data on the rural sector are nearly nonexistent; what information exists is poorly organized and difficult to access.   The Government?s strategy. The  Government in Burundi must deal with the following basic issues in agricultural and rural development: (a) how to raise production and productivity and how to diversify sources of income in rural areas; (b) how to improve access to such essential factors of production as extension, quality seed and new agricultural technologies, farm inputs, and rural finance; and (c) how to improve access to markets and ensure that there are enough institutions in the sector  to deliver efficient services and to preparing and monitor investment projects. According to the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy and other documents, the Government seeks to promote broad-based agricultural and rural growth by (a) supporting and reintegrating displaced persons and other victims of conflict into agricultural production processes; (b) stimulating rural employment, through development of public works programs and small and medium-size enterprises and industries; (c) increasing access to markets, through rehabilitation and development of agricultural and rural infrastructure and removal of agricultural trade bar</a><br />
