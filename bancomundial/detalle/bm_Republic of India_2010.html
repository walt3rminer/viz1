Formulate an inclusive and integrated Citywide Slum Upgrading Plan. 2.   Create an enabling environment for urban poverty and sector reforms to contribute to the planned implementation of slum upgrading on a city-wide basis. 3.   Strengthen local institutions and their capacities to design and implement participatory slum upgrading projects. Sub objectives 1.   Build consensus among various stakeholders, including DUDA, on the city slum upgrading and poverty reduction strategy prepared earlier under CA-supported CDS. 2.   Develop citywide slum upgrading plan in synergy with the slum upgrading strategy and the CDP Agra. 3.   Recommend an upgrading strategy for each slum settlement based on situation analysis in the settlement including its legal status, level of services and environment, quality of housing stock, preferences of the community and its willingness and ability to pay, among other things, drawing on the CA knowledge base on successful global practices. 4.   Prepare an inclusive city wide slum upgrading plan, and a prioritised and phased road map for its implementation, adopting a consultative approach involving various stakeholders including ANN, DUDA, Agra Development Authority, public utilities, social welfare departments and the community, including youth groups. 5.   Facilitate the process of restructuring municipal norms for service delivery in the poor communities and for housing the poor. 6.
