To attain this objective, the following two outcomes are expected: (i) improvement in program quality owing to renovation of the curricula and training of literacy teacher trainers; and (ii) strengthening management of the system through improvements in the partnership-based approach between the Government and service providers.  This LIL will contribute to decisions regarding subsequent scale-up by helping to determine: whether users find that curricula have been adapted to their needs; teacher training and support have been institutionalized; literacy institutions and providers show increased capacity to manage program growth; an effective sector evaluation and monitoring system has been established; unit costs are considered reasonable; and political will exists to support scale-up. The loan will finance ongoing evaluation of these elements.</a><br />
