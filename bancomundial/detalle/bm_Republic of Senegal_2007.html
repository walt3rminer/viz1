This one-tranche operation would be the third and final of a planned series of PRSCs and will aim to address the five cross-cutting and institutional issues that were emphasized in PRSC-I and PRSC-II:   # Fiduciary reforms of the State, by strengthening budgetary and financial procedures (including those linked to remuneration of the public sector), and procurement; # Decentralization by securing financial transfers to local governments, as well as disseminating and implementing the PRS agenda at the local level;  # Health services, with a focus on improving information, financial and human resources management in the sector, as well as improving access to basic health services that have been identified as the most important factors for determining the performance of this sector; # Wealth creation through the support of ongoing reforms in the labor market and improvements in the judiciary system; and  # Protection of vulnerable groups through the implementation of the national Social Protection Strategy.</a><br />
