The expected impact is to increase the number of mobile applications entrepreneurs in Africa.  The expected intermediate results are the hosting of events (around 30 in four cities in the first 18 months of the project) to promote innovation in the mobile sphere, targeting around 1000 participants from 400 or so companies, NGOs, government agencies and other organizations that would participate in the online and offline activities, and promoting the visibility of the African chapters at a global level, for instance through a dedicated webspace and competitions with winners to gain entry to international events, such as infoDev's Global Forum for Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Helsinki (May/June 2011). The main knowledge output of this activity will be inputs to the Mobile Flagship Report (GLO 1 under TF071399) to evaluate lessons learned from this experiment in social networking and to show the development potential of mobile applications.</a><br />

The PRSC focuses on the following development objectives: (i) reduce income poverty, (ii) improve key human development objectives, and (iii) improve the capacity of the Government to design and implement development policies in a transparent and efficient manner.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P121961" target=_blank>The objective of this activity is to promote technology-enabled entrepreneurship in Tanzania by building the capacity of local stakeholders to set up and run an effective business incubator. Expected Impact In the long term, the desired impact of the activity is that there will be more, and more competitive technology enabled enterprises in Tanzania, thus leading to increased incomes and jobs as well as technology solutions that lead to social or economic gain.  However, this cannot be measured within the project time frame.  The team will therefore measure the project outcomes by assessing if the clients have implemented the guidance provided. Knowledge Dissemination infoDev will prepare a "lessons learned" note at the conclusion of this project that will provide guidance to other entities that seek to set up business incubators in a developing country context.</a><br />
