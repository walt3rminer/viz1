The Project Development Objective (PDO) remains unchanged from the original grant. It is âto contribute to the development of t he Recipientâs capacity to design a sound national REDD+ strategy, develop national and sub-national reference scenarios, and esta blish a forest monitoring and carbon accounting system, all consistent with local, regional, and national conditions and circumstanc esâ. 2. In addition to the three results indicators identified in the original US$3.6 million grant, it is proposed that two new  results indicators are added. The additional results indicators reflect aspects of the National REDD+ Readiness Process that were n ot fully addressed in the US$3.6 million grant, but that would be addressed under AF. 3. The achievement of the original PDO is be ing measured through the following indicators: a. A SESA is prepared and endorsed by national stakeholders including competent gov ernment agencies. b. Conditions and circumstances impacting the National Reference Scenario (baseline) are quantified and discussed  with relevant stakeholders.c. Studies on drivers of deforestation, revenue sharing options, and investment options that further st rengthen the national REDD+ Strategy are prepared and endorsed by the Government, after discussion and validation by stakeholders.  4. The achievement of the proposed AF Grant objectives would be measured through the following additional results indicators:d. In donesia will be REDD+ Ready (based on the assessment criteria of the Readiness Package).e. Large-scale emission reduction program a t the sub-national level will be designed to pilot the implementation of REDD+.</a><br />
