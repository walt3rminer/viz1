The objectives of this project are to: a) capacitate the district government and small-scale contractors to undertake LRB road works; b) provide techniques, standards, systems and strategies for this approach, and; c) involve local communities in the provision and maintenance of district and other rural roads.</a><br />

This will be achieved by: 1) rationalizing and assuring competency-focused accreditation of public and private health professional training institutions; 2) developing national competency standards and testing procedures for certification and licensing of health professionals; and 3) building institutional capacity to employ results-based grants for encouraging the use of accreditation and certification standards in the development of medical school quality.</a><br />

The proposed DPL 6 supports the GoI#s reform efforts in i) improving the investment climate through strengthened investment service institutions and regulations (revised investment negative list, simplified investment licensing procedures), enhanced trade facilitation as well as reduced tax burden and improved tax administration; ii) enhancing public financial management through improved results orientation in the budget process, streamlined budget execution and improved cash management as well as improved public procurement systems; iii) enhancing poverty reduction and improving service delivery through increased funding for poverty programs, improved targeting of poverty programs and improved poverty measurement.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">250000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P115102" target=_blank>The objective is to improve the quantity and quality of infrastructure investment through policy measures in areas including energy, roads, water, PPPs, land acquisition, environment and Public Works governance.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P118813" target=_blank>The overall development objective of this grant is to reduce poverty and vulnerability among female-headed households in the poorest parts of Indonesia. The proposed grant will facilitate the training of women leaders and develop the capacity of local women's organizations to set up special programs that benefit female heads of households in poor provinces. It will achieve this by: (a) linking targeted programs for female-headed households with the government's nationwide National Program for Community Empowerment (PNPM);(b) developing a pilot leadership program for grass roots women organizers; and (c) providing hands-on support for newly established programs for female-headed households involving newly trained women leaders in nine (9) provinces.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">300000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P108757" target=_blank>PNPM's overall objective is to reduce poverty. Its means are to promote community participation in development planning and management. A community-based approach will not only help fill Indonesia?s large tertiary infrastructure gap efficiently, but more organized communities will promote more efficient delivery of higher-order services.   PNPM?s approach to poverty reduction is not divorced from macro-level factors such as improving the overall investment climate or building larger network infrastructure and service supply systems. But engaging communities directly in localized poverty reduction efforts has already been shown to be an efficient, sustainable way to cover very large, poor populations in ways not otherwise available to public agencies.  The potential benefits of the PNPM program are projected to be significant. A preliminary economic assessment of PNPM showed that by 2009/2010, when the program would cover all kecamatans at the proposed benefit level of Rp. 3 billion per subdistrict, it could benefit nearly 14 million families and increase their income by 11 percent on average by providing about 60 days of work. Some 7-9 million households would be pulled out of poverty. Furthermore, over two-thirds of the expected benefit stream is indirect, the result of the increased economic activity created by PNPM, primarily from improved economic infrastructure, and the importance of those indirect benefits continues to increase in later years.  PNPM is meant to extend until 2015. It will go through two phases. The current phase is the scale-up, when it rises from the current, 2007 level of some 40,000 urban and rural villages covered by the KDP, UPP, SPADA, and PPIP programs, to full national coverage of 80,000 communities by 2009/2010. At that point it moves into a sustaining mode. During this period local governments will take on greater responsibility for financing. GOI also expects to bring supply-side initiatives from health, education, rural development and other sectors into the PNPM umbrella to maximize complementarities for poverty reduction.  During PNPM-KDP?s 2007-2009 scale-up period, the program?s core architecture will not deviate in any significant way from the existing KDP. KDP already is a very large project and its core operating systems were both designed for future scale-up and have already demonstrated their ability to incorporate an increased scope.  The three main differences between the KDP3a and by operations and the project being proposed for appraisal are:  ? Block grants rise from an average of Rps. 1.2 billion per subdistrict to approximately Rps. 2.1 billion;  ? The number of subdistricts rises from pproximately 2,020 in 2007 to 2,600 in 2008; and  ? A new level of government oversight, coordination, and policy guidance.  Project appraisal, therefore, can proceed on the basis of a great deal of known information about the project?s strengths and weaknesses. PNPM's overall objective is to reduce poverty and improve local-level governance in rural areas of Indonesia through the provision of investment resources to support productive proposals developed by communities, using a participatory planning process.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">2000000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P115199" target=_blank>The proposed Public Expenditure Support Facility (PESF) of USD 2 billion i s a DPL with Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO). Its main objective is to assist the Government of Indonesia (GoI) in addressing the potential adverse impacts of the ongoing global financial crisis on public expenditures during 2009/10. Learning the lessons from the crisis of 1997/98, the Go1 would like to ensure that essential public expenditures are maintained even during this period of stress. Therefore, the Go1 would like to put in place arrangements that would give international and domestic markets confidence to enable it to raise needed resources from them. These arrangements include a set of  confidence-boosting policy measures and back-up financing arrangements - a part of which is the proposed loan. This support would be available, if the current stress in the market continues and is aimed at reducing the possibility of a financing shortfall. The loan will support the GoI#s efforts in the following policy areas: (1) reassuring financial markets and maintaining financial system stability (2) sustaining critical public expenditures while maintaining budget discipline and (3) facilitating private investment and supporting exports.</a><br />
