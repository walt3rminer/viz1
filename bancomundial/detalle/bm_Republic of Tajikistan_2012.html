The project development objective is to enable rural people in selected uplands to build their productive assets in ways which sustainably increase rural productivity and curtail natural resource degradation.  The proposed project, a fully-blended IDA- and GEF financed operation, is a follow-on to the successful Community Agriculture and Watershed Management Project.  The project components comprise the following activities:  (i) Expanding sustainable upland rural production and resource management through small subprojects in farm productivity, land resource management and rural infrastructure; (ii) Capacity building and institutional support comprising facilitation support and technical advice; support for local level service organizations; training, dissemination and networking; and analysis, research and monitoring; and (iii) project management and coordination. Regarding the administrative budget for project preparation,  we are aware that there are currently no regular BB funds allocated in FY11 for P122685, and that the CU currently has no unallocated  funds. Hence we don't plan to even raise this until the mid-year budget review. We've put in $100,000 for BBLEN total in this AIS, knowing that much of this would be FY12, and in the hope that some of it could be provided for the second half of FY11 if the CU finds the funds.  Unless and until we get that budget, we plan to depend on BBFAO and BBGEF for SUALEM LEN, and the BB for CAWMP SPN.</a><br />
