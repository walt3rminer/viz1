This will be achievedthrough two components: Operational Development and Support (including formation of the real estate cadastre in priority urbanareas, support for secondary transaction system, focused support for the REC in Belgrade, IT systems modernization, and legalextension services); and Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening (including public awareness campaigns, businessplanning, training, IT strategy, legal framework completion).</a><br />

The principal aim of the Additional Financing is to enable the Borrower to complete the original scope of the Project (energy efficiency improvements in 3 social care buildings, 9 schools and 6 hospitals left out due to a cost overrun) and to scale up energy efficiency improvements to include: (a) rehabilitation of the heat supply system of the Nis Clinical Center along with energy efficiency improvements in all 17 contiguous buildings on the campus; complete retrofitted lighting in a number of schools and (b) energy efficiency improvements in a number of social care institutions, schools and hospitals across Serbia.</a><br />
