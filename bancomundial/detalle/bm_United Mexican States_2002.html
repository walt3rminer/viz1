Specifically, the project will support aspects of the recently completed Third Air Quality Management Plan (AQM-III 2002-2010) (Programa para Mejorar la Calidad del Aire en la ZMVM 2002-2010) which are consistent with the GEF Operational Program on Sustainable Transport (OP-11) and the Metropolitan Climate Change Action Plan (MCCAP).</a><br />

This is proposed to be achieved by: (a) consolidating the rural financial institutions sector (including setting up an information system and providing training to institutional staff), and enhanced and rigorous supervision of the performance of the participating institutions, at both the principal (CNBV) and auxiliary levels (Confederation and Federations); (b) improving the outreach capacity of the rural financial institutions and evolving newer and relevant financial instruments on the one hand, and providing technical assistance and training to communities in marginal areas to link up with these financial institutions, on the other; and (c) undertaking studies to inform the strategy and policy relating to rural finance.</a><br />
