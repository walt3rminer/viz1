The three PFM areas are: (a) national budget planning, dissemination, and analysis, (b) local (district, municipal and village) budget planning, dissemination and analysis, and (c) local monitoring of procurement, budget execution and service performance.</a><br />

This objective will be achieved through (i) the development of capacity to assess the structural integrity of schools; (ii) training of local engineers,  foremen and masons in seismic safe construction techniques; (iii) support to contingency planning, and (iv) sensitization of local officials and communities.Key Outcome Indicators:(i) Increase in the school population housed in structurally safe buildings;(ii ) Increased capacity of public officials and local engineers to assess structural integrity of public buildings;(iii) Increased num ber of local engineers, foremen and masons trained in seismic safe construction techniques;(iv) Increased number of communities wit h contingency plans;(v) Increase in awareness of seismic safe standards among local officials and at the community level.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P130089" target=_blank>The objective of the proposed project is to enhance the country capacity for the prevention and control of infectious diseases thattransmit between animals and humans (zoonoses) under a One Health approach. This is a necessary first-step in reduction in the incidence of infectious diseases from animals to humans which will also lead to increase livestock productivity and strengthen the livelihoods base for food insecure communities. This objective would be achieved through two types of interventions: planning and preparedness; and prevention.   If successful, the proposed project would contribute to reduce the burden of disease in animals, the consequent economic losses, the risk of human infection, and the loss of productivity attributable to animal and human infections in Nepal. In addition, this project will specifically link up with the GAFSP-financed project that is being prepared in parallel, to supportthe realization of these outcomes in the mid- and far west regions of Nepal . The project would also leverage with and contribute to enhancing the Climate Resilience Agriculture Management Information System, which is prepared by the PPCR.</a><br />

This innovative project aims at addressing a root cause of unrest and distress migration by enabling the beneficiaries to access sustainable livelihoods by strengthening their traditional skills and make inroads into mainstream markets.</a><br />
