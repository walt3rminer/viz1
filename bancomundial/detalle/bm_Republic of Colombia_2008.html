The principal project de velopment objectives are:  - Complement the income of poor families with minors under 18 (SISBEN level 1 and the displaced) - Promote human capital formation of  poor children by increasing regular check-ups, including growth monitoring, and  vaccinations and by increasing enrollment and school attendance (basic and/or s econdary education) - Strengthen program quality</a><br />

Specifically, the program has the following objectives: (i) improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the National Environmental System (SINA); and (ii) integrating principles of sustainable development into key sectors, with a particular emphasis on protecting the most vulnerable groups.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P103015" target=_blank>The objective of the project is to improve solid waste final disposal practices in the two landfills of Cartagena, Colombia. Such improvement will be carried out through landfill gas capture and flaring facilities, to be installed at each site. Once operative, the plants will be able to flare the methane that is part of the landfill gas, therefore contributing to mitigate the global warming effect. Moreover, air quality is expected to improve as landfill gas usually contains hazardous substances, such as non-methane volatile organic compounds, that will be destroyed in the flaring process.</a><br />

Improved mobility. This component includes actions for continued expansion of the second phase of the Transmilenio system and continued improved access to public transport. It comprises the following activities: (i) construction of busways, (ii) construction and rehabilitation of feeder routes which connect neighborhoods to the Transmilenio system as part of an integrated system; (iii) construction of bicycle paths and sidewalks as part of non-motorized transport facilities; and (iv) measures for improving public transport, road safety and traffic administration in the city of Bogotá. B. Urban upgrading. This component is designed to support the activities of the Programa de Mejoramiento Integral de Barrios (PMIB), which is the District's urban upgrading program derived from the POT and PD. CVP is the institution in charge of coordinating the infrastructure works and social activities in selected low-income areas located in 12 UPZs. The infrastructure works comprise: (i) planning and neighborhood plot legalization; (ii) construction of storm water drainage systems, water and sewerage systems (iii) construction and rehabilitation of access roads; (iv) resettlement of population located in high risk areas, including flood plains; (v) construction and rehabilitation of public space and community services; (vi) improvement of environmental conditions; and (vii) technical assistance for home improvement and land tittling activities. The  social activities associated with the physical works include: (i) promoting citizen culture; (ii) strengthening social organizations; and (iv) assisting vulnerable population. C. Institutional strenghtening and Technical Assistance. This component is aimed at improving the performance of the institutions in delivering urban services through activities that will guarantee the social, environmental and financial sustainability of the works undertaken by the proposed project. The activities include technical assistance for District institutions working in areas ranging from transport, housing and environmental management sectors, to planning and financing urban development activities. Specifically, this component will support equipment, training and consulting services.</a><br />
