The project is designed to achieve its objective through a multi-pronged approach that will that will address key bottlenecks to SME financing and development in India, by focusing on: (a) creating a more enabling policy, regulatory and institutional framework for SME financing by banks (the primary target group for this project); (b) helping banks gain better access to longer term financing for lending to the SME sector, thereby facilitating capital formation and technology up-grading; (c) mitigating banks' risks related to SME lending and reducing transactions costs of such lending while, at the same time, ensuring that banks enhance the quality of their SME loan portfolios; and (d) strengthening business development services and market linkage programs for SMEs (the secondary target group), thereby  helping SMEs to improve profitability and competitiveness, and become more creditworthy.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P085345" target=_blank>The global environmental objective of this Montreal Protocol operation is to support international efforts to restore the stratospheric ozone layer to its original level in order to provide the earth's living organisms with the full benefit of the ozone layer's protection from solar radiation.  India's effort on the carbon tetrachloride (CTC) front is part of India's national program for the phaseout of ozone depleting substances controlled under the MOntreal Protocol. The project will therefore support the India's objective to reduce its Protocol-controlled CTC production and consumption level to zero by 2010. While it is impossible to directly link India's efforts with specific achievements/development outcomes related to the recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer, it is worth noting that India was the second largest consumer of ozone-depleting substances among developing countries and that its efforts are essential for the long term recovery of the ozone layer.</a><br />

By improving access to technical expertise and advisory services the proposed operation is expected to assist reform-minded governments (central, state, and municipal) as well as Public Sector Units and other Agencies (both state and central) to build a multi-sector investment pipeline and advance the preparation work of specific investment operations. The main objectives of the proposed TA for Project Development.are to: - Assist government entities in pursuing sound reform and investment strategies; and - Support comprehensive preparation of investment projects for implementation with Bank financing; Pursuant to the aforesaid objectives, the proposed TA project will support : (a) policy formulation and institutional development (b) detailed project preparation including engineering studies, environmental and social assessments, etc. This is also expected to help improve overall portfolio implementation performance of Bank assisted projects.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">104980000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P084632" target=_blank>The Project Development Objective (PDO) will be to extend and promote the sustained and effective use of the HIS by all potential users concerned with water resources planning and management, both public and private, thereby contributing to improved productivity and cost - effectiveness of water related investments in the 13 States and with Central agencies.  The coverage  of existing states under the project is to help these agencies from moving over from development of HIS (as in HP-I) towards use of HIS in water resources planning and management. The PDO will be achieved by : (a) strengthening the capacity of hydrology departments (surface and groundwater) to develop and sustain the use of the HIS for hydrological designs  and decision tools thus creating enabling environment for improved integrated water resources planning and management; (b) improving the capabilities of implementing agencies at State/Central level in using HIS for efficient water resource planning and management reducing vulnerability floods and droughts and thereby meeting the country's poverty reduction objectives; (c) establishing and enhancing user - friendly, demand responsive and easy accessible HIS to improve shared vision  and transparency of HIS between all users; and (d) improving access to the HIS by public agencies, civil society organization and the private sector through awareness building supporting outreach services.  Greater use of an improved HIS is expected to have a broad but definite impact on the planning and design of water resources schemes, from which the rural and urban poor will have secure and sustainable access to water for multi - purpose livelihood uses.   The conceptual framework of outcome and output indicators is outlined below. Specific measurable indicators will be developed by the project's Management Consultants in consultation with the participating agencies, during the design of the project monitoring system.</a><br />
