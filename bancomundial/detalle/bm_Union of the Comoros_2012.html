The DPO supports implementation of Government-owned reforms spelled out in four of the PRGSP’s six strategic axes, namely: (i) axis one, on economic stabilization and equitable growth, emphasizing improvements in fiscalpolicy and public financial management; (ii) axis two, on strengthening key sectors by focusing on institution-building and ensuring a broader role for the private sector, with this operation supporting reforms in  the fisheries and energy sectors; (iii) axis three, on strengthening governance and social cohesion, focusing on improvements in core government personnel management systems and stepping up the fight against corruption; and (iv) axis six, on promoting environmental sustainability and civilian security, emphasizing improved disaster risk management. The proposed DPO is a central element of the Bank’s ISN for FY10-12 and is fully aligned with its second objective to strengthen state capacity and accountability. The proposed DPO is being prepared at a time when the country is aiming to meet the HIPC Completion Point and to benefit from significant HIPC and MDRI relief. Implementation of the reform program is being supported through a Bank-financed Economic Governance Technical Assistance project that complements this operation.</a><br />
