The key performance indicators of the project are, therefore, focused on the relevant measures of quality and efficiency.</a><br />

To achieve this, three areas would be supported by the project: (i) prevention; (ii) preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and containment.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">5000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P098850" target=_blank>The development objective of the Project is to facilitate infrastructure investments that have strategic importance and/or special complexity by ensuring that proper feasibility work is carried out in a timely manner in order to enable the government to make sound investment decisions, and where appropriate, to proceed expeditiously with further preparatory steps and mobilize adequate financing for implementation.  The focus on energy and transport sectors is consistent with Governments investment priorities and CPS objectives. Specifically, the Project will finance technical assistance (TA) to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of identified investments through preparation work including technical and sectoral studies, engineering design, and analysis of economic, financial and environmental feasibility, as well as financial and legal advisory services, where required.</a><br />
