Government requested IDA assistance through a Supplemental Credit to the ongoing credit to permit financing of the cost of repair and reconstruction of ARWC facilities damaged by the November 25, 2000 earthquake.  The Supplemental Credit provides financial assistance for three activities: (i) repair specific components of the Kura and Jeiranbatan water treatment facilities and another operational structure (one warehouse) that suffered damage during the earthquake; (ii) repair sections of the water distribution network and related structures that suffered the most during the earthquake and are causing increased water losses in the system through more frequent burst; (iii) construction supervision and project implementation consulting services.</a><br />
