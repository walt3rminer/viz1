The primary objective of this project is to improve the livelihoods of poor forest dependant communities by strengthening their access to and control over natural resources. The expected outcomes include 1) increased capacity of self-initiated community institutions to exercise their rights and responsibilities in forest management and decentralized planning; 2) coordination among service providers (state forest department, tribal institutions/local panchayats, NGOs, other line agencies) improves; 3) stakeholders acquire new roles, skills, and incentives to support, regulate, and monitor participatory forest management; 4) increased opportunities to access and market forest and non-forest products; and 5) expanded forest resources provide increasing returns (usufruct to communities and ecosystem services to society) over time.</a><br />
