The Global Environmental Objectives are:  (a) improving biodiversity conservation; and (b) contributing to climate mitigation by sequestering carbon dioxide in forests in the Kyrgyz Republic.    The above objectives will contribute to poverty reduction by increasing local peoples' access to forest benefits such as fruits, nuts, fuel and construction wood, forage, employment generation, and revenues from carbon trading and tourism. The project will contribute to national environmental and social benefits for the two countries' newly forested areas will not only improve soil conservation and biodiversity protection by providing habitats for threatened species, but also generate revenues that will increase the financial sustainability of protected areas. Finally, the carbon trading scheme will contribute to increasing revenues, expanding knowledge, and developing a replicable carbon trading model for the region. The large majority of these benefits, however, will materialize after project closing, creating a monitoring challenge.</a><br />
