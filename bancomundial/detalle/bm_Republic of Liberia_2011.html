<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">5000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P127319" target=_blank>The objective of the proposed project is to "Improve budget coverage, fiscal policy management, financial control, and oversight ofgovernment finances in Liberia"In order to achieve the development objective, the project would support the implementation of reform actions identified in the GoL approved PFM Reform Strategy under the following key themes: (i) Improving budget credibility; (ii) Expanding budget coverage and strengthening budget execution; (iii) Strengthening revenue mobilization; (iv) Enhancing transparency and accountability in PFM; (v) Enhancing controls and respect of the PFM legal framework; and (vi) Strengthening treasury management. It will establish tangible improvements in transaction processing, reconciliation, and fiscal and financial reporting procedures; and improve budget management and resource allocation and administrative capacity to gradually develop Liberia's own institutional, organizational, informational, and human resource capacities.  The PFM Reform Strategy objectives against each of the themes are addressed in the project components as designed, where one or more objectives have been combined for efficiency and implementation sake.  The Strategy is anchored on five basic criteria: sequencing of major actions; simplicity and realism; lessons learned in prior reforms; ownership and sustainability; and partnership and collaboration.</a><br />

More specifically, the RRSPIV focuses on: (i) improving the capacity for and transparency of public procurement; (ii) improving internal control procedures and the capacity for internal audit; (iii) improving revenue administration and (iv) improving land administration to reduce conflicts and enhance the investment climate.</a><br />

Liberia's forest areas are thus one of Africa's highest conservation priorities. The Bank's intervention in this field to date, in the context of the LFI, and GEF, has resulted in the review of the forest concessions, the protection of the only declared national park in Liberia (Sapo Park) and the creation of a Protected Area Network including three new protected areas (lake Piso, Gola and Wonegizi). This project would constitute another step in the process by creating two additional new parks (a Wetland Park south of Monrovia  called the Marshall Wetlands of about ha 50,000 and a Park bordering Ivory Coast, called Grebo of about ha 100,000). The Project global objective is to contribute to the conservation of the globally significant biodiversity of Liberia Component 1: Strengthening the Capacity of the Forest Development Authority (FDA) Conservation Department ($ 200,000) After 14 years of civil conflict, the FDA has weak capacity in protected area management and community engagement. The funds of this project will provide training and equipment to FDA Conservation Department. Expected outputs: "   10 qualified staff in place and performing in FDA (both in Monrovia and in the field) Component 2: Creation of New Protected Areas and Community mapping ($ 500,000) The project will fund consultations at local and central level prior to the legal establishment of the two additional proposed protected areas. A special focus will be on piloting the "community mapping" approach in Liberia by compiling maps showing the overlap between the proposed demarcations of the two new protected areas with the extent of community land claims in the two areas. The maps will be useful to resolve land conflicts and inform dialogues and negotiations between communities, government agencies and conservation organizations. The project will also fund PA infrastructure, demarcation and equipment as well as operation costs of proposed PAs on a declining basis (including support to government staff involved in the local consultations and demarcation procedures). "   2 National PAs demarcated using the community mapping approach and under improved management, as measured by GEF METT tracking tool "   Basic infrastructure for the 2 PAs put in place "   Management plans for the 2 PAs elaborated and approved by relevant institutions and stakeholders Component 3: Development of Community Livelihood Programme around Protected Areas  ($300,000) The project will support communities through the identification and promotion of sustainable income-generating activities that will reduce dependencies of communities living on the fringes on natural resources of the selected two additional PAs. The project will fund assessments on the natural resources and the potential for timber and non timber forest products with potential commercial value through market analysis, value addition and strengthening the entrepreneurial capacity of local community members (using relevant materials such as the FAO Market Analysis and Development approach for Community Forestry Enterprises). "   20% of communities around the new parks are involved in sustainable income-generating activities (e.g. agroforestry, apiculture, palm oil).</a><br />
