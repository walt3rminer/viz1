<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P071439" target=_blank>Objectives The first objective of the project is to reduce China.s greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollutions from coal-fired power generation by accelerating the adoption of the integrated gasification and combined cycle (IGCC) technology. The second objective is to help the Chinese government to develop and to gradually implement a .zero CO2 emissions from coal strategy. and plan for a pilot hydrogen production and CO2 sequestration project, as a first, practical step to implementing such a project.  Project Description The proposed project consists of the construction, commissioning, operation, demonstration and replication of a green-field 300-400 MW IGCC plant at Yantai, Shandong Province, and the development of a long-term strategy to gradually achieve zero CO2 emissions from coal-fired power generation in China.  The overall IGCC plant train system would include an air separation plant for producing oxygen, an entrained coal gasifier, a gas clean-up system to remove sulfur gases, ammonia and ash, and a combined cycle power generation system.  Other important auxiliary systems comprising the plant would include coal grinding equipment, a pressurized coal feed system, and associated heat exchangers to heat and cool gas streams.  The State Power Grid Company, Shandong Electric Power Group, Shandong International Investment and Trust Co., and Yantai Power Development Company will form a Special Purpose Company to build, operate and manage the Yantai IGCC plant.  The plant would be designed to use indigenous high sulfur, high calorific value and low ash coal.</a><br />
