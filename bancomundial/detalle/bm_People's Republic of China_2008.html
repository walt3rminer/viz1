This will be achieved by undertaking high priority investments in selected project cities in wastewater collection and treatment systems and solid waste management systems, as well as institutional reforms and capacity development in the areas of municipal utilities reforms and water pollution control.  As its secondary objective, the project is intended to develop well-managed sustainable municipal utilities which could be referred to as models/best practices for other similar projects or programs to be implemented under the Provincial 11th Five-year Plan.</a><br />

Although it's objectives are similar to those of IAIL2, IAIL3 would focus more on raising productivity of land and water, rather than only production; and on enhancing the farmer income and the farmers' share of higher market values, rather than raising income solely through higher production.  And IAIL3 would add important innovations to modernize agriculture and enhance farmer competitive capacity.  The competitive challenges resulting from China's entry into the WTO are driving these changes.</a><br />
