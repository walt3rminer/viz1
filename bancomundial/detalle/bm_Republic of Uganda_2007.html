The plan already has 4 MW co-generation system and surplus bagasse is disposed through open field burning.  The project is to expand the project sponsors bagasse co-generation system from to 21 MW.   9 MW is for internal use and 12 MW will be supplied to the national grid during daytime (6:00-18:00) and peak hours (18:00-24:00).  KSW already has an Energy Purchase Agreement with Uganda Electricity Transmission Company (UETCL). By this agreement, UETCL will purchase 6MW of electricity only during peak hours.</a><br />

The project entails installation and operation of a 3.5 MW (2 uni ts of 1.75 MW) hydroelectric power plant, which became operational in September 2012.</p><p>The project also upgrades and extends the distribution networks in Paidha, Nebbi, and Arua municipalities, in order to connect 4,000 additional customers, who would other wise operate small, privately-owned generation facilities.</p></a><br />

As spelled out in the Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy (UJAS), the PRSC continues to be a core element of the Bank's support for Uganda, supporting four pillars of the PEAP: Economic Management (pillar 1); Enhanced Production, Competitiveness and Incomes (pillar 2); Good Governance (pillar 4) and Human Development (pillar 5).</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P102462" target=_blank>The objective of the project is to increase piped-water access for Ugandans living in selected small towns and RGCs in a sustainable manner through increased participation of local private operators.  Achieving this objective should result in:    # less time spent collecting water at distant water points, and therefore increasing the possibility that resources are spent on other productive activities # including attending school (many of the water carriers are young girls);  # a reduction of disease and death related to water borne illness;  # localized and cost effective solutions for system design, including more co-ordination between system design, maintenance and operation;  # improved financial viability of the existing water supply systems, including mobilizing alternative sources of finance for the sector; and,  # a more transparent use of funds in the water sector.  The main development objective of increased access will be measured by the number of increased working connections of a specified quality in the respective small towns and RGCs.  More specifically, this will be measured by an increase in the number of yard taps and public water points (or, stand posts).  To increase access for the poorest and reduce the cost of water throughout the towns or RGCs, a minimum number of public water points should be constructed and operated.  To ensure that the pilot will result in least cost solutions, the project will involve competitive tendering for the private operators that will construct and operate the systems.  The extent of success of the competitive tendering will be measured by the resulting lowest subsidy required to deliver the outputs and manage the systems.</a><br />
