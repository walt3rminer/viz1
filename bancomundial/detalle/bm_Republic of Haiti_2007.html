<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">9000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P104690" target=_blank>The development objective of the project is to reduce the country financial vulnerability to natural disasters (earthquakes and hurricanes) of Haiti.  This will be achieved through the establishment of the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) and the financing of catastrophe insurance coverage from the Facility.  The project aims to allow Haiti to join the CCRIF and benefit from financial protection against catastrophic earthquake and/or hurricane events.  Without this grant, it is unlikely Haiti would join this pilot initiative that represents the first entity created to protect small island states from the financial impact of natural disasters.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">5000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P089839" target=_blank>Development Objective: Increase access to and use of water supply and sanitation services in participating rural communities.    Specific Objectives:  ? Increase the sustained and effective use of safe drinking water in participating communities;  ? Improve use of sanitation and hygiene practices in participating communities;  ? Strengthen the capacity of the implementing agency, local water committees, and professional operators in cooperation with local government.  Given low capacity in the Haitian public sector and previous implementation experience with Bank projects in Haiti, (i) project design has been kept very simple, (ii) substantial capacity building has been included, and (iii) objectives have been kept modest. At the same time, coordination with other stakeholders (government agencies, donors, and NGOs) is being actively sought beyond the partnership with IDB, which is financing this project in parallel.  Key indicators will be: Number of beneficiaries gaining access to and using sustainable   water systems  in participating localities, and number of beneficiaries gaining access to and using basic sanitation systems  in participating localities</a><br />

The operation would also support ongoing efforts to help create a culture of public participation in the monitoring of economic governance reforms.</a><br />
