<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P128680" target=_blank>The objective of the CIC is to support Kenyan SMEs involved in developing locally-appropriate solutions to climate change mitigation and adaptation.  The outputs produced that will achieve this result are: technical advisory services to SMEs, reports that explore and recommend government policies that will create a regulatory environment that increases the prospects and possibilities for such SMEs, provision of information helpful to the SMEs in the form of websites, written reports, and workshops/conferences that discuss the market potential of relevant technologies, the latest developments for the relevant technologies and other areas; and the provision of technical and office facilities (including communications and utilities) that selected SMEs can use. Description of the activity's expected impact and how that will be tracked (M&E): The impact of the CIC will come in the number of relevant SMEs that are assisted in their efforts to develop and deploy innovative solutions to climate change that meet local needs.  This will be assessed with measurements on the quantity of SMEs that are active recipients of the outputs described above. Description of how the knowledge generated by the activity will be disseminated (seminar, workshop, online discussion, etc.): There will be substantial knowledge generated by the activities of the CIC.  This knowledge will relate to best practices to support the development, transfer and deployment of advanced climate technologies and business models in a way that directly supports local capacity to do so, targeting the essential SME community in its key role in the innovation process and ecosystem. This knowledge will be disseminated directly through the CIC in written reports, local conferences and a website, and also internationally (via the same methods) through the planned East African regional community of CICs and related actors and globally through the network of CICs.</a><br />
