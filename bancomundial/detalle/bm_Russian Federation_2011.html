IBRD is considering usage of a Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) instrument, which may support a possible transaction between the Government of Russia (represented by the State Corporation "VneshEconomBank", VEB) and an international financial institution with sufficient liquidity available (Credit Swiss, for example), where IBRD is ready to consider the issuance of a PCG extended to a commercially funded loan to VEB, provided that the design of the transaction and the implementation mechanisms would correspond to IBRD's requirements and policies and that appropriate indemnity agreement is reachable with the Government of the Russian Federation.</a><br />
