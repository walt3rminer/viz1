The proposed Technical Assistance for the Implementation of the National Environment Policy will finance technical assistance and targeted actions aimed at supporting the MOE in the implementation of its National Environment Policy. More specifically, the project aims at assisting the government with: "   Strengthening institutional framework of the MOE and the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) at the Federal and provincial level "   Development of strategies and action plans to support sustainable infrastructure development and economic growth "   Development of a national strategy for climate change "   Development of initiatives and implementation of targeted actions aimed at limiting environmental pollution thus reducing the overall costs of environmental degradation. "   Promoting sustainable economic growth through the adoption of cleaner production practices in all major economic sectors "   Promoting conservation of natural resources The scope of the assistance that will be provided to the government includes the three components described below. Opportunities for building synergies between components will be identified at further stages of project preparation, based on the definition of the specific activities and interventions that will be supported by the operation. A.   Institutional strengthening. This component will support the government in the strengthening of institutional capacity at the MOE and EPA to implement the NEP. This will involve financing: (i) design an implementation of an organizational framework that is in line with the pillars of the NEP and that allows the development of consistent strategies and action plans with clearly defined mechanisms to facilitate NEP implementation at the sub-national level; (ii) promotion of inter-institutional coordination among all relevant government agencies, provincial authorities, research centers, NGOs, and other relevant stakeholders that address environmental management issues; (iii) program to strengthen the capacity of technical MOE and EPA and provincial agencies staff to apply policies aimed at preventing undue harm to the environment (e.g. environmental impact assessment, protection of natural habitats, forests and integrated pest management); (iv) training in procurement and financial management; (v) information systems; and (vi) adequate training, infrastructure and logistical support to ensure that staff have the adequately tools to effectively and efficiently carry out their duties B.   Climate change and carbon finance. This component will assist the government in the development of a national strategy for climate change covering both adaptation and mitigation aspects. The strategy will identify priorities for action that will increase private and public sectors' abilities to mitigate and adapt to the environmental and socio-economic impacts of climate change, while simultaneously contributing to address the national environmental challenges identified by NEP. This component will also support the development and preparation of programmatic carbon financing operations in various sectors, of which carbon sequestration through afforestation and reforestation has been identified as a government priority. C.   Reducing the cost of environmental degradation. This component will support the government in its efforts to offset the costs of environmental degradation through actions in priority areas identified by the MOE and documented in the Strategic Country Environmental Assessment. This component will finance design and implementation of policies and initiatives to: (i) reduce outdoor and indoor air pollution; (ii) improve water supply, sanitation and hygiene; and</a><br />

The proposed operation (US$ 360 million) will finance construction of about 200 km of the expressway system. The proposed project development objective is to improve trade flows and lower transit costs and times along the NTC by providing a high-speed, safe and reliable access-controlled expressway system. Development impact will be judged on the basis of the following indicators on the Project road sections: (a) Impact Indicators: (i) 33% reduction in commercial traffic travel times, (ii) 10% decrease in vehicle operating costs, and (iii) 50% reduction in road fatalities/100 km of road normalized for traffic levels; (b) Output Indicators: (i) About 200 km of expressway constructed, (ii) Overloading reduced by 50%. The principal target group is internal and external trade and commerce, which will benefit from reduction in transport and transit costs and times for goods using the NTC.</a><br />

It would therefore directly support the GOP's commitment to improved public financial management, accountability, and transparency, and enhance the capacity of public sector managers in menaingfully using credible financial information for better and informed decision making.  It will facilitate public oversight of the use of public monies, and increase the national and international credibility of Governments' financial statements and assurance processes.</a><br />

This would be the second project to assist the Government to fight the HIV epidemic.  The first project that closes in December 2009 supports interventions for high risk populations, improving blood safety, capacity building and program management and improved prevention among the general population through mass media campaigns and advocacy. The second operation will focus primarily on expanding coverage of HIV preventive services to high risk populations including injecting drug users and sex workers through province-wide contracts.  It will also aim to improve treatment and care of people living with HIV through improving access to and quality of treatment facilities. In addition, the project will strengthen monitoring and evaluation particularly of targeted interventions and of the treatment and care component. The Government has developed costed plans for the next phase of the program from 2008-2013 that have been approved at the provincial level and are awaiting approval by the Federal Government.  The total estimated cost of the Program over the next five years is approximately $100 million. Proposed Bank financing is tentative estimated at $55-60 million allocated as follow: 80 percent for scaling up services to high risk groups and 10 percent each for monitoring and evaluation and treatment and care respectively. DFID has indicated its willingness to finance the resource gap.</a><br />
