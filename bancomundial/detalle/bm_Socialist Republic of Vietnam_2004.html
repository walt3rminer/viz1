<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P080074" target=_blank>The overall development objective of the proposed project is to improve access to good quality, affordable electricity services to rural communities, in an efficient and sustainable manner to support Vietnam's efforts towards socio-economic development.  The development objective of the proposed project would be achieved through: (a) major upgrading and /or expansion of rural power networks in about 1200 communes; (b) conversion of current ad-hoc local electricity management systems to local distribution utilities (LDUs) as legal entities recognized under Vietnamese law, to improve management of power distribution in rural areas, improve financial sustainability, and better enable future mobilization of private funds; and (c) capacity building assistance for the LDUs, provincial authorities, participating regional power companies, and national authorities involved in the planning and regulation of rural electrification. The proposed project would improve access to energy to about 2 million households in Vietnam, including many living in some of the poorest communes. The project also will enable supply of large increases in electric power for expanding productive uses in rural areas, alleviating a major constraint to local economic growth.</a><br />
