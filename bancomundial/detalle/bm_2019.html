The decisions on land delineation for specific management purposes rest with the chiefs in consultation with the communities. Currently the challenge is one where allocation of forest areas for agricultural purposes to communities is made by the chief, and as a result the forested areas within the chiefdom are shrinking over time. Several chiefdoms have recognized the problemand are willing to set aside forest areas within chiefdoms for conservation use known as community conservation areas (CCAs). The interventions in CCAs will include land use planning, and preparation forest management plans by communities for managing conservation areas through implementing practices that will ensure that the forest areas are sustained. Agreements between chiefdoms and COMACOinclude provisions for implementation. The agreement also requires the Chiefs to submit a benefit sharing plan that will ensure fair distribution or usage of revenue channeled through the sale of Emission Reductions generated from the Project.</a><br />
