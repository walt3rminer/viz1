In pursuing this objective, the project will assist in (a) accelerating the economic transformation of the rural economy by increasing the flow of investment capital to the sector, (b) augmenting the role of the pr ivate sector in the rural economy by (i) improving access, on the part of rural households with entrepreneuri al activities and private enterprises, to financial services and by (ii) helping regulated private financial intermediaries to augment their presence in rural localities and in filling the vacuum that may ensue after t he privatization of state banks and the likely closing of a significant portion of the existing network of ru ral branches; (c) facilitating accession to the European Union (EU) by assisting the rural economy to absorb the grants that will be allocated under the EUÂ’s Special Accession Program for Agriculture and Rural Developm ent (SAPARD) by making available counterpart funding for the private investments that will be financed by thi s program, and (d) alleviating rural poverty by financing farm and off-farm investments for poor segments of the rural population which currently have no access to credit. The project also seeks to improve the legal an d institutional environment for financial transactions to reduce the costs and risks assumed by lenders when allocating rural credit, especially to the relatively poorer segments of the population.</a><br />
