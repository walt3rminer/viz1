A secondary, but nevertheless equally important objective, is that the new payments systems satisfy inte rnationally accepted standards and core principles and thus ensure a high level of user confidence in the WAEMU financial systems.  A well-functioning payments, clearing and settlement system is key to an efficient financial sector, and plays an important role in  reducing credit, liquidity and systemic risks in the system. By supporting the implementation of a state-of-the-art payment system  for the entire WAEMU region, the project would contribute to the development of non-cash transactions, the strengthening of banks,  the deepening of the financial sector, and, more generally, increased regional integration and the expansion of trade and investmen t among and within member countries. To achieve these objectives, the project has five components: (i) project support; (ii) a real time gross settlement system (RTGS, r enamed STAR-UEMOA: Système de Transfert Automatisé et de Règlement); (iii) a low value clearing system (COMPENS), renamed SICA: Syst ème Interbancaire de Compensation Automatisé); (iv) an inter-bank card system; and (v) a common telecommunications and computer infr astructure based on BCEAO's facilities. (i) global project support which includes developing the legal framework and administrative support; (ii) The RTGS component includes the establishment of a RTGS at the regional level which would be open to banks and other financial  instruments. (iii) The low value clearing component would upgrade existing systems at the national and regional levels to make them more efficien t. It will be designed to meet the daily low-value payment needs of a braod spectrum of users and will cover a variety of payment in struments (checks, automatic debits and credits, payment orders, card payments, etc) (iv) The inter-bank card system would develop a common bank card product, enabling any bank customer to use it at any automatic tell er machine (ATM) or participating merchant's facility (point of sale - POS) in the sub-region (v) For all three payment systems, the BCEAO telecommunications satellite network would be used to effect transactions with a high d egree of security and at a low cost. Local networks would have to be built and secured for connecting banks' local branches and ATM  and POS facilities.</a><br />
