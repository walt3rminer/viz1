The specific objectives of the EMRP 2 are to assist the government to: (a) facilitate agricultural marketing in specific areas with high agricultural potential that have been affected by the conflict, (b) reconstruct and rehabilitate critical infrastructure, and (c) strengthen capacity of participating ministries and agencies for improved governance and transparency and of local governments for future decentralization. These objectives build on the objectives and activities of EMRP 1 and are consistent with the ECP and the PPMRRP.</a><br />
