JRP2 will support the Armenian judiciary in implementing a second stage of judicial reforms launched by passage of Constitutional amendments and the introduction of a new Judicial Code.  Achievement of the Project Development Objectives will be measured by performance indicators, including Government and judicial operational statistics supplemented by: (i) measures of court performance and user perceptions (BEEPS); (ii) expert assessments of judicial qualifications and training (American Bar Association's CEELI Judicial Reform Index); and (iii) project funded monitoring and evaluation efforts (court users survey and NGO court monitoring).</a><br />
