The proposed operation would take the form of a quick-disbursing Credit, to be disbursed in two tranches during calendar year 2000.  The local counterpart resources that the Credit would generate would be utilized to support the Federal Government of Nigerias (FGN) recently created Poverty Reduction Fund (PRF).</a><br />
