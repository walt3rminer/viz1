The intent of this project is to allow Azersu (the Water Supply Company) to install water meters on the Apsheron peninsula and to enable Azerigaz to expand its metering program as well.   The installation of both sets of meters will facilitate revenue collections and provide incentives to limit consumption.  The project will also include some funds for pre-investment technical assistance related to the below described water supply project.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">5000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P099099" target=_blank>The project has been restructured with the help of additional financing to finan ce a cost overrun due to higher costs for the rehabilitation and completion of t he irrigation and drainage infrastructure works under the original project.  The  cost overrun mainly occurred due to: (i) an increase during the last few years in the price of construction materials, in particular steel and cement, and fuel ; and (ii) a greater than anticipated volume of rehabilitation work for one comp onent of the project.  The Additional Financing is required to fund all the orig inally planned activities in full, specifically the rehabilitation and enlargeme nt of the Samur-Apsheron Canal (SAC) main supply system from km 27 to 50.  It wo uld thus mainly be used to carry out the last civil works contract, but there wo uld also be small allocations for the financing of consultants.  The original pr oject development objectives and expected outcomes remain unchanged.</a><br />
