To attain this objective, the focus of the project is on piloting small-scale community-based initiatives in selected demonstration communities under an integrated development framework designed to respond to priority social needs and facilitate the transition from conflict to peace. The project supports a participatory development process at the local level that is inclusive, gender-sensitive and responsive to community priorities.  Project outputs will consist of infrastructure and services sustained by capacity building. The project will also support the Government's decentralization initiatives designed to increase the competencies and accountability of municipal administration, increase the participation of citizens in decision-making and ultimately, enhance empowerment at the local level.</a><br />
