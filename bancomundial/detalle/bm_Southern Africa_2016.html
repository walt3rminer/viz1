Other major generation developments are envisioned in the future including developing the North Bank of the existing Cahora Bassa dam.  It is anticipated that the first of these generation projects, Temane, would begin commercial operation as early as 2012, followed by Moatize and Mphanda Nkuwa within the next five years.  The combined new generation capacity could exceed 4,000MW.  The Government intends to ensure that the energy needed to develop Mozambique industry and to meet domesticdemand is available within Mozambique, as part of the development of this power generation potential.  It is also anticipated that some of the electricity produced will be exported to SAPP countries.    In order to realize this generation potential, significant investment is required in new transmission infrastructure.  A pre-feasibility, options study was completed in 2005 to assess the costand preliminary design features of a Mozambique Transmission Backbone project which would connect the generation centers in Tete Province with teh trasnmission network in the south, a distance of 1,300km, as well as serve as a route for electricity export to the Southern African Power Pool via the South African network.    The findings from the study indicate that the total investment required would be up to $1 billion, although the overall project could be implemented in stages.   The Government recognizes that in order to finance this significant undertaking it is likely that both public and private sources of financing may be needed. A key objective for the Government is to keep the overall cost as low as possible, which would mean accessing concessional financing to the full extent possible.    The Mozambique Transmission Backbone Project will support the development of the transmission backbone linking Tete Province with the south of Mozambique.  World Bank participation in the project will be critical in terms of structuring and anchoring a bankable project, and will serve as a catalyst for raising the required financing.    Remark: This is a multi-phase APL program which would involve up to 10 countries of the SAPP. This first APL involves Mozambique.
