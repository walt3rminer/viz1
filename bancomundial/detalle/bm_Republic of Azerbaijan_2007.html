The Guneshli Oil Field was discovered in 1958, and the first oil produced in 1980.  The oil and gas extraction is based on 12 operating off-shore platforms, from 9 wells producing only gas, and 125 wells that produce oil and associated gas. Due to the decreased well pressure of the gas, there is about 1mln cubic meters of associated gas vented into air a day from 78  wells, and it is expected that once the pressure drops  in remaining  wells, the volume of gas vented into air would equal 3mln cubic meters. The Project Developer is preparing a Guneshli Associated Gas Utilization Project for collecting, compressing, and transporting the associated gas from Shallow-Water Guneshli Gas and Oil Field that is currently vented to the shore for distribution and sale in the domestic market for various uses. Carbon Financing is essential as a catalyst for this operation. The size of the carbon financing, and the nature of a potential World Bank project shall be determined during the detailed project preparation.</a><br />
