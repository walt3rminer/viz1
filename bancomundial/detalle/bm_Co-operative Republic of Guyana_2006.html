Building on the reforms supported by PRSC-I, the proposed operation aims to improve the transparency, accountability, and efficiency with which overall resources are utilized across the public sector.  In addition, the PRPMO will help improve the Government's institutional capacity to monitor progress under the PRSP, evaluate the impact of poverty reduction programs, and improve the statistical information for poverty analysis and targeting.  Finally, the operation will support actions to strengthen environmental management and regulations to ensure the sustainable use of Guyana's natural resources.</a><br />
