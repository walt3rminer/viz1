<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">40000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P114167" target=_blank>The Fourth Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO IV) continued to support the Government of Georgia in the implementation of policy reforms in the areas of: (i) strengthening public sector accountability, efficiency, and transparency; (ii) improving electricity and gas sector services; (iii) improving the environment for private sector development; and (iv) improving social protection, education and health care services.  PRSO IV was the last of this PRSO series, (a follow-up programmatic Development Policy Credit series is currently under preparation.)    Following the August 2008 conflict, the Board approved in October 2008 a Supplemental Credit to the PRSO IV in the amount of $40 million equivalent. The objectives supported by the PRSO IV remained valid and were not altered.  The Supplemental Credit provided additional budgetary support to the Government to help efforts to sustain implementation efforts of the PRSO program in the face of unanticipated budget financing needs associated with the August 2008 conflict, including the needs of internally displaced people (IDPs) and other conflict-affected people, repairing and rehabilitating of damaged infrastructure, and initiating an economic recovery program [see Georgia: Joint Needs Assessment Report, October 2008, the World Bank and the UN with the participation of ADB, EC, EBRD, EIB, and IFC].</a><br />
