The task will consist in helping the Government of Peru creating a Guarantee Facility for future infrastructure projects.  The facility will dispose of a pre-authorized financial envelope available to award World Bank partial risk guarantees to infrastructure concessions and privatizations in Peru.  Criteria will be pre-agreed upon regarding the type of projects eligible to apply for a guarantee, as well as regarding eligible risks. The Guarantee Facility will enable the Government of Peru to carry forward its remaining privatization / concession program.  The latter includes about 15 projects in most infrastructure sectors.  Most of these projects are not financially viable without some form of Government subsidy or guarantee, although all are economically desirable for the country.  Therefore, the Government intends to bid the projects to the private sector, allowing for the possibility of some pre-defined form of Government subsidies. For each project, the amount of subsidy would constitute the bid criterion so as to minimize its value. The proposed World Bank partial risk guarantees would back up the Government of Peru's guarantee and subsidy obligations resulting from its contractual agreements with future concessionaires. Preparation of the task will be funded via a credit line.</a><br />
