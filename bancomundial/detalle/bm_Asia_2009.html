As such the health of tiger populations is a useful indicator of the health, effectiveness and sustainability of the region's protected area networks. Moreover since tigers are wide-ranging species which require large landscapes  to maintain viable populations,  effective conservation measures are required both within, and beyond, protected area boundaries to maintain biological corridors and tiger habitats within the broader production landscape and to strengthen  policy and regulatory frameworks to  protect tigers from national and international trade. Improved protection of tigers and their habitats, and improved enforcement capacity along potential trade chains, will benefit other globally-important  species with which the tiger  shares  forests and grasslands within the range states. Tigers are Asian religious and cultural icons, the national animal in some countries and figure on the flags of others. However, within the last century, their numbers have plummeted from over 100,000 to below 4000 animals. Tigers are listed by IUCN as Endangered, because their total effective population size is estimated at below 2,500 mature breeding individuals, with a declining trend due to habitat and prey base loss and persecution, and no subpopulation containing more than 250 mature breeding individuals. The existing wild populations inhabit fragmented and isolated patches of land that constitute just 7 per cent of their historic range. Habitat loss and trophy hunting were once the primary threats to the tigers' survival. Conversion of habitats to agriculture and other intrusive uses led to sharp declines in tiger numbers through the 1970s and 80s. Habitat loss is still an issue, but poaching of tigers and their prey is now the most urgent and immediate threat to tigers. Tigers are killed for the flourishing illegal trade in tiger parts for traditional oriental medicine, clothing, and home decor. Legal international trade in tiger products has been banned since 1975 through inclusion of the species in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) . However, the illegal international trade in wild tigers remains highly profitable, well-structured and has close links to other organized crime. Poaching of tiger prey is a further major threat. Even though legislation is in place to protect tigers throughout their natural range, wildlife agencies frequently lack resources, expertise, and sometimes political support for effective enforcement of laws. Much of the illegal demand for tiger parts and products originates from large urban areas in tiger range states whose own tiger populations have been reduced or extirpated. Poaching has become so intense that tigers have disappeared even from some protected areas where they were once thought to be secure. The consequences are particularly damaging in areas with a depleted prey base due to poaching or habitat degradation, where tiger numbers are already low and growth is slow because cubs are at high risk of starvation. Serious though the situation is, it has been shown that with good protection, tiger populations can recover quickly and are therefore a reliable indicator of conservation efforts and healthy ecosystems, as has been well illustrated for the Amur tiger in the Russian Far East This project will address the major threats to tiger conservation, and the large natural landscapes on which they depend, through three interlinked components. The project will provide a framework for collaborative efforts between the range states (and the national and international NGOs working within them) and complement national efforts targeted to individual sites. As part of the project the Bank will organize high-level Country Dialogue Workshops in each of the range states as well as offer to host a Year of the Tiger Summit in 2010 to build</a><br />
