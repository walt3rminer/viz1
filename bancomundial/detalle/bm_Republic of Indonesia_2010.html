The current series is itself a continuation of an earlier program of four loans (Indonesia DPLs 1 through 4) and supports further reforms in the same three key areas:  (1)improving the investment climate; (2)strengthening public financial management; and (3) enhancing poverty alleviation and service delivery efforts. Under each of these three areas the DPL program supports the advancement of a number of more specific reform aims. A preliminary set of indicative triggers for DPL-7 was suggested by the relevant GoI counterparts and agreed to during the preparation and appraisal of DPL-6. During the identification and preparation of DPL-7 the status of these actions will be reviewed and discussed with GoI counterparts in the new government that took office in October 2009. It is conceivable that in light of this dialogue, adjustments may need to be made to the proposed program, including the possibility of initiating a new program of DPLs aligned to the new government's medium-term development strategy. The work on the DPL program (including DPL-7) is closely integrated and coordinated with the ongoing technical assistance and advisory work being undertaken by the large TF-funded teams working in each of the three areas covered by the program.
