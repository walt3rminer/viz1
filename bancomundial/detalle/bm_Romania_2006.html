<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">200000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P089078" target=_blank>The objective of the project is to support the implementation of the Government of Romania's strategy for the restructuring of the district heating sector, to improve heating services and the reduce the subsidy burden on the budget.  The strategy was approved in June 2004 - it was a condition of the Romania PAL1.  Legal measures were enacted during 2004,  to provide a legal basis for some of the actions in the DH Strategy, including metering of heat consumption.  The proposed project would provide:  (1)  heat metering and heat control facilites (thermostatic valves), over time, across the country in a large number of cities.  The proposed Bank loan would finance such equipment for poor households (households that are eligible for heating subsidies); and (2) DH system rehabilitations in selected cities. Cost estimate of US$125 million is tentative.  The size of the Bank loan is shown as $75 million,  but the range is $50-100 million at this time.  A significant part of the balance of project financing,  shown in the table to be provided by the Borrower,  is expected to come from project beneficiaries, households paying for their meters and heat control facilities.  Cost estimates and financing plans would be refined during the preparation.  If the new country financing parameters are confirmed, the Bank may increase its share of project financing.</a><br />
