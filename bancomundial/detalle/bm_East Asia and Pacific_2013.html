More specifically, the program supports the operationalization of communities of practice ( CoPs), a steering committee, and the PEMNA secretariat that facilitate member countries to: (a) exchange experience on specific, hig h priority PFM reforms and their implementation; (b) analyze common challenges faced; and (c) benchmark their own performance to one  another. The program operationalizes the network where members have sense of belonging, with formal and informal contact, with posi tive results with regard to learning and the application of learning, and with a knowledge resource base for members.</a><br />

The project will facilitate achievement of GEF International Waters (IW) Objective 3, Outcome 3.3 (IW Portfolio capacity and performance enhanced from active learning, knowledge management and experience sharing.  This Regional MSP will cover China,Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam and knowledge management support to the GEF/WB platform program on Scaling Up Partnership Investments for Sustainable Development of the Large Marine Ecosystems of East Asia and their Coasts.  The project will support the collection, review, packaging and dissemination of lessons learned and best practices demonstrated under the investment projects co-financed by IBRD/IDA and GEF in these four countries. The knowledge management support system is intended to contribute to strengthening political commitments of national and local governments, donors and private investors for upscaling and replication of successful projects, tools and procedures. The specific goals of the project are to establish a regionally and country-owned knowledge platform that i) facilitates the integration of investments in sustaining ecosystem services into national and regional economic and development policies, processes and plans; ii) strengthens linkages to the sustainable development agenda adopted by countries of the region (i.e., the Sustainable Development Strategy for the Seas of East Asia or SDS-SEA); and iii) enhances capacities and services at the central and local government levels for developing and implementing investment projects. In order to achieve this goal, the project will bring together policy makers, local chief executives, project managers, practitioners, adademia, investors and the business sector, and will work through a range of activities under three components: A regional ICM e-Library and knowledge sharing portal: A regionally and country-owned knowledge platform and portal to promote dialogue and improve the exchange of knowledge, information and methods within and between countries on Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) and investment in sustaining marine and coastal ecosystem services, and a connection to existing and emerging networks and initiatives across the region and globally.  This knowledge sharing portal would connect to the WB Knowledge Portal to be established under the Global Partnership for the Oceans, which would provide global data on a series of ocean health indicators, including area of coastline/country under ICM. Innovative tools and best practices: a system for identifying, packaging and transferring new and innovative approaches and best practices to policymakers andpractitioners and for facilitating the mainstreaming of time bound priority targets andprojects under the brown and blue agenda into national and local government medium-term development and investment plans. Communities of practice and support services:  a support mechanism for national and local governments, providing access to and use of skills and experiences in the region and globally, as well as new and innovative tools and prctices, for the development of investment projects.</a><br />
