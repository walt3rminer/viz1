(ii) strengthening the capacity of mu nicipalities, communities and NGOs, in planning, implementing, and monitoring co st-effective poverty alleviation intervention; and (iii) establishing a central capacity to coordinate, monitor and evaluate the National Poverty Alleviation Pr ogram (NPAP).

This would be achieved through: (a) financial sector reform, including  pension reform; (b) investment climate reform, which includes, but is not limited to: (i) tax reform, (ii) alleviation of administr ative barriers, (iii) improved supply chains, and (iv) legal reform; (c) post privatization and divestiture reforms; and (d) private  sector and institutional capacity building. The project would thus help sustain the Government's poverty alleviation efforts by gen erating increased employment opportunities through improved international competitiveness.</a><br />
