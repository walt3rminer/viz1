The economic measures announced by the new government will have an impact of the vu lnerable groups, and the loan will help in protecting them from the negative shocks resulting from these meas ures.  The loan will include measures in health, education, social assistance, and pensions.  At the same tim e the loan will assist the government in the design of policies to  improve the efficiency and targeting of so cial spending.  The second and third programmatic loans will be centered  on the implementation of structural reforms in the social sectors.  As reforms are implemented in other areas like tax policy, competitiveness, a nd rationalization of public expenditures, the following two loans will  include measures tending to improve the quality and level of investment in the social sectors.
