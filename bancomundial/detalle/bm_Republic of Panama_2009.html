The new operation would benefit landless small farmers, especially young people, who are currently working as "jornaleros", and promote their access to lands with high potential for productivity (most likely in the provinces on the Pacific cost). Based on the experience of other countries in the Region (e.g., Mexico, Brazil, and Bolivia), the new operation would support organized groups of farming households in obtaining loans and matching grants to purchase or rent productive farm lands. The acquisition or rental of a parcel of land would be accompanied by complementary activities to help small farmers implement sustainable productive projects. Beneficiaries would receive technical assistance and training in innovative and profitable on-farm and off-farm activities and techniques, marketing, organization and management to help them preparing successful business plans that are environmentally sound. The new operation would include a smaller component to support the geographical expansion of land administration activities to cover additional rural areas in the provinces of Panama and Col√≥n and costal areas, thereby completing such activities in the entire country jointly with the IDB operations.</a><br />
