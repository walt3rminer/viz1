The implementation of the reform program will help to (a) clarify relationship between GOB and BR and increase BRs autonomy and accountability, (b) improve corporate governance and management structure within BR so that BR is more commercially and market oriented, and (c) create an environment conducive to increase investment in railway operations. These would in turn yield more efficient rail operations and services to users, improve financial performance, and provide the basis for a growing market share for the railway sector.</a><br />
