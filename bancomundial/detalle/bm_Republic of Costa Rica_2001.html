Most of these changes are part of second-phase reforms in the Costa Rican Soci al Security Institute (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social, or CCSS).  For the s hort- to medium-term, these policy changes will:  (a) align the organizational a nd functional structure of the CCSS with recent changes separating financing, pu rchasing and provision of health services at all levels; (b) promote improvement s in quality and fulfillment of consumer rights, as well as the efficiency and e ffectiveness of the Ministry of Health (MH) as a regulatory agency, by strengthe ning the institutional and regulatory framework; (c) improve the quality and eff iciency of the CCSS health delivery system by supporting decentralization of dec ision-making, consolidation of the primary care delivery network based on a popu lation-based system, and introduction of performance-based incentives for provid ers; (d) reduce inefficiencies in the pharmaceutical sub-sector and promote rati onal drug use by introducing changes in the planning, purchasing and distributio n of pharmaceuticals and supplies; and (e) develop financial mechanisms that wil l improve the equitable distribution of resources, improve efficiency in the pro vider payment mechanisms and strengthen the CCSSs capacity to collect payroll co ntributions.</a><br />
