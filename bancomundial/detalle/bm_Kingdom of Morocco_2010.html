<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">100000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P112612" target=_blank>The proposed loan is the second of the second series of programmatic loans designed to support the implementation of the Government#s public administration reform support program (PARAP) whose objectives are fully shared. The objectives of the series aim at : (a) improving Government efficiency in the management of budget resources through greater transparency and accountability, and by introducing performance measurement; (b) improving government efficiency in the management of human resources through the preparation of a new management system for staffing and remuneration with performance measurement, while streamlining current human resources management; (c) consolidating and controlling public payroll; and (d) improving public services and simplifying procedures through e-government.  The proposed loan is complemented and strengthened by an ongoing multiyear Programmatic Economic Sector Work activity through which the Bank is providing the Government with advice, training, and  technical assistance as required in the areas of public finance management, civil service reform, and wage bill containment. A new technical assistance activity has just been approved for the e-government component. Other donors supporting this program provide complementary technical assistance.  Support to the public administration reform program is a key component of the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) (FY10-FY13). PARL IV contributes to the achievement of the first and second CPS pillars: (i) promoting macro-economic stability and private sector development as an engine of growth and (ii) support to the improvement in access to, and quality of services. In addition the operation is fully aligned with the CPS cross cutting theme of enhancing governance.</a><br />

The rapid growth of financial institutions in recentyears has contributed to Moroccos growth performance and expanded the frontiersof finance. However, itis also apparent that, despite significantimprovements, the financial system is not yet providing services to largesegments of low income households and SMEs. Moreover, this rapid growth hasalso generated new risks in the banking, insurance and microcredit sectors thatneed to be effectively managed. The global financial crisis added importance tofurther reforms.The Government has launched a four pillar reform program that addresseseffectively the dual objectives of access and stability. The first pillarcontains measures that promote access to individuals while the second pillarcomprises measures to enhance access to small and medium enterprises. The thirdpillar strengthens the resiliency of the financial system through further andimportant improvements in financial regulation and supervision. The fourthpillar, capital market development, contributes both to access and stability, bypromoting competition to banks, and introducing better instruments of riskmanagement.</a><br />
