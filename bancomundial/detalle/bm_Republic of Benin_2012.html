The PDO would be broken down in two intermediate outcomes: (i) improving the quality of maternal and neonatal health services for the whole population; and (ii) enhancing the utilization of these services by the poorest. Although the project would reinforce the health system as a whole and have an impact on several health MDGs, this PDO is # conservatively - limited to maternal and neonatal care, as this MDG is well known to be strongly influenced by Health System Strengthening (HSS) activities.  The second PDO is to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Health. This PDO is also composed of two intermediate outcomes: (i) improving the allocation of Government health funding across districts and facilities; and (ii) strengthen MoH capacity and readiness for SWAp implementation. The objectives of the Project are: (i) to increase coverage of quality maternal, neonatal and child health care services in the Targ eted Areas, and (ii) to strengthen the institutional capacity of the MoH.</a><br />
