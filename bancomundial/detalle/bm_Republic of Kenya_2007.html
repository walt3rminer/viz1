<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P106635" target=_blank>The objective of the Redevelopment of Tana Power Station Project is to rehabilitate through replacement the existing Tana power station which is a run-of-river hydropower generation plant. The project will use the existing water transmission system including penstocks through which water is currently fed to the existing powerhouse. A new powerhouse will be built in the project site during rehabilitation to replace the existing one which will be taken out of operation. The project will utilise water from the Tana and Maragua Rivers to generate electricity. The objective of the Optimisation of Kiambere Hydro Power Project is to upgrade the turbines with new runners at the existing Kiambere power plant instead of conducting the regular maintenance. This upgrade will increase the plant’s generation capacity by 20MW from its existing capacity of 144MW. The existing (2 x 72 MW) turbines will be replaced with new cavitation-free runners of (2 x 82 MW). In the past five years, existing capacity has supplied on average annual electricity amounting to 917.4GWh to the Kenyan grid. The additional 20MW capacity will supply an estimated annual incremental power of 49.1GWh  to the Kenyan grid. With this additional capacity, the total electricity supply to the grid from the Kiambere power plant will be 966.5GWh per year.Both projects will result in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions by displacing fossil fuel-based electricity generation in the Kenyan grid with clean hydropower.</a><br />

Progress towards achieving the project development objective (PDO) will be monitored through a set of indicators including: (a) Number of men and women actively participating in decision making at community and district levels; (b) Percent of community and youth investment projects rated satisfactory or better by participating communities; (c) Percentage increase in real income of households in project intervention areas; and (d) Percentage reduction of financial cost induced by average annual flooding in the Budalangi flood plain.</a><br />
