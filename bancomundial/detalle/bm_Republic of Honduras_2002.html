The project will  improve access and quality of health care services for the low income population served by the Ministry of Health (MOH).  It will also support the ongoing efforts to improve the performance of the Honduran Social Security Institute (IHSS) and to ensure that increased social security contributions, as mandated by the Law amending the 1959 Social Security Law recently approved by the Honduran Congress, result in expanded membership and quality of services to the insured population.</a><br />
