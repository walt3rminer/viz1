The two overarching objectives are therefore to: ·,,reduce short and medium term fiscal pressures from social programs through a combination of entitlement reform and efficiency improvements in the social sectors; and ·,,maximize the poverty alleviation impact of public spending through improved targeting and sustained access for the poor to cash benefits and services, including health and social welfare.  The main areas proposed as the focus of the SOSAC-supported reform agenda are consistent with the priority objectives of the Bank.s TSSU, and are: ·,,systemic reforms to the PAYGO pension system which should make it more fiscally sustainable, including preliminary steps in institutional reform, and also developing the legal framework for operation of voluntary private pensions. ·,,reforms in reporting and collection of social insurance payroll taxes, and budget formulation and audit of the Pension and Health Funds.  These measures should improve payroll tax compliance and increase transparency in budget formulation and execution in EBFs. ·,,reforms of non-pension cash transfers . including social assistance, child protection and unemployment programs -  in order to improve the poverty alleviation impact of the social safety net in a manner consistent with existing fiscal and institutional capacity. ·,,measures to stabilize public sector health finances, including ensuring financing for vulnerable groups, reduction of co-payment exemptions, and reforms in drugs policy. This would be complemented by efficiency-enhancing measures to improve the information base of the health sector and initial measures to develop a facilities rationalization program which would address structural inefficiencies in health services; and ·,,ongoing implementation of representative household surveys in order to monitor living standards and evaluate the social and fiscal impact of current and planned public policies. .
