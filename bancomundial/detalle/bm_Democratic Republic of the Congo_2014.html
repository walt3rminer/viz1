The PDO would be achieved by supporting the Government's hydro-met services (particularly MettelSat) in: optimising the collection, management and sharing of data on water and weather conditions based on agreed realistic criteria and resources; integrating resources provided through remote sensing and regional/global forecasting centers; improving the skills and motivation of staff in the implementing agencies; and ability to absorb new technologies and solutions for delivering relevant hydro-met information to users in relevant sectors.The PDO could be achieved and sustained through tailoring the project to ‘core’ needs of prioritised sectors. Thereby, the project can serve as a foundation for building climate resilience and economic growth in these sectors.</a><br />
