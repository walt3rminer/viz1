<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">100000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P096555" target=_blank>The objectives are to: (a) reduce the social and economic costs of environmental degradation of rivers in Dhaka and (b) develop a programmatic approach to water resources and environmental management in the Dhaka metropolitan area for strategic long-term activities and investments.  Dhaka Metropolitan Area (DMA)water resources need to be managed and developed more effectively in order to cope with demands generated by population increase and economic growth. Water quality and quantity management is a key issue in achieving poverty reduction in Bangladesh and meeting the MGDs. The project would engage authorities dealing with the management of Dhaka environment and water resources in a comprehensive effort to avert urban environmental degradation by providing technical and financial support for invetsment in capacity building and low cost treatment of industrial effluents. One key issue to address is pollution, especially of the rivers in and around Dhaka and to link the quality and quantity of the water resources to water supply and environmental services provision in the DMA. For this an "urban watershed" approach would be developed and activities and investments could be prioritized within a strategic framework to address the water resources situation, reduce pollution from land based sources and mitigate health hazards to DMA. Proposed Project Objective 1. Reduce the social and economic costs of environmental degradation of rivers in Dhaka through improved management of land and quality of rivers, better institutional coordination and community involvement, enhanced pollution control and sustainable investments in low cost treatment and clean up measures. 2. Develop a programmatic approach to water resources and environmental management in the DMA for strategic long-term activities and investments.</a><br />

The first activity is the establishment of the Secretariat. This objective will be achieved by establishing, staffing and training a Secretariat at MOEF. The short term role of the Secretariat is to handle day to day activities of the ongoing the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (BCCRF). By doing so, it will gradually acquire the necessary tools and capacity to enable MOEF to directly administer trust funded activities. The Secretariat will also create a one stop shop for various climate change projects and initiative currently under way in Bangladesh.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P123629" target=_blank>The purpose of this social protection pilot is to identify ways to improve the ability of both urban and rural local government bodies to effectively implement social safety net programs.  Accordingly the pilot aims to test the modalities of cash transfers to the poorest of poor families delivered through Pourashavas (semi-urban local government bodies) and Union Parishads (rural local government bodies), and subsequently demonstrate the value of administering these programs at the local level in terms of better targeting and less leakage of resources. In addition, innovative features that would be part of this pilot such as using proxy means testing for selection of beneficiaries and information technology for the management of benefit delivery make this approach particularly attractive and important for the future design of the country's social protection programs. Specifically, the pilot is expected to help draw lessons on how to strengthen the role of Pourashavas/UPs in establishing administrative systems to (i) select and target the poorest families based on proxy means tests; (ii) make cash payments through the local banking sector; (iii) forge links with schools to monitor school attendance and nutritional status of children of beneficiaries; and (iv) timely monitor cash payments so that benefits are delivered in an effective and transparent way.</a><br />
