<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P118605" target=_blank>Task Description The project would purchase ERs generated by the replacement of about 9 to 10 million ILs with CFLs during 2009-10 in 10 urban and rural areas with the largest population concentration in Bangladesh at the rate of 4 CFLs per household. The plan is to install an additional 15 to 20 million CFLs in the subsequent phase.  The purchase will be made by the World Bank managed Spanish Carbon Fund (SCF).  Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) would be the coordinating entity and the bundler for the project.  The imcome earned from the sale of the ERs will be placed in a renewable energy fund, managed by IDCOL, and will be used to finance variousenergy efficiency project. Introduction of CFLs on a large scale will reduce demand for electricity and decrease the use of fossil fuels.  This will have a positive impact on local air quality by reducing pollutants generated by fossil fuel based power.  Reduced electricity bills will increase disposable income.  Since CFL bulbs last longer, it will also reduce household expenciture on purchasing lamps.  In the short term, the deployment of CFLs on such a large scale will create employment opportunities, institutional development through the enhancement of program management skills and training, and increase local knowledge of energy efficiency.

In particular, through demand-side mechanisms, the project aims to: (i) expand access to quality primary education?especially for the disadvantaged; (ii) increase completion and transition rates for students enrolled in non-formal Learning Center; (iii) achieve comparable or better classroom conditions for students in non-formal Learning Centers as compared to formal schools; and (iv) evaluate the cost-effectiveness impact of a well-defined intervention to address problems of quality and access.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">257000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P117542" target=_blank>The proposed project will make available partial debt financing through private sector financial intermediaries for eligible, government-endorsed infrastructure projects to be developed by the private sector. Projects developed solely by the private sector but identified by Government to be in the public interests, such as captive power plants, will also be eligible for financing. The project will also seek to assist the Government of Bangladesh in facilitating new infrastructure projects with potential for private sector participation and in developing the capacity of the financial sector for the ongoing provision of infrastructure finance. The developmental goals of the proposed project reflect key priorities identified by the World Bank Bangladesh Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), namely (i) to accelerate private-sector led growth; (ii) to support an integrated approach to rural development; and (iii) to strengthen government and build institutions.</a><br />
