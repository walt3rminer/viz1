While Lesotho has achieved respectable growth rates in the last few years, poverty remains widespread and unemployment levels are high. The growth fueled by a sharp increase in mining output has not been broad-based as the sector is not labor absorbing and has few forward and backward linkages in the economy. The garment sector employs about 50,000 workers, but prospects for further increases are uncertain given the global liberalization and erosion of preferences. Particular objectives of the growth strategy are to address the most critical constraints facing the private sector to achieve private sector led broad-based growth which is considered to be an essential ingredient for poverty reduction. High SACU revenues have made possible high levels of public expenditures. For the Government to use these resources in a way that contributes to growth and improved welfare of its citizens requires a further strengthening of its public financial management systems and improvements in service delivery. By supporting the implementation of policy and institutional reforms, the PRSC series is expected to contribute to broad-based private sector led growth and poverty reduction.</a><br />
