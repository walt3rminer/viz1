The project will achieve this by:  1)   Overcoming the risk barriers in the financial markets inhibiting commercial bank participation in energy efficiency project financing;  2)   Demonstrating the feasibility of packaged investments in higher-cost energy efficiency measures in buildings and increasing acceptance of energy performance contracting mechanisms in Poland; and  3) Stimulating the demand for energy efficiency services in the buildings sector and increasing awareness and capacity of commercial banks to originate and implement loan transactions for EE investments.</a><br />

There are four specific Project Development Objectives, which include: (a) uneconomic mines are closed in least cost cost and environmentally satisfactory manner so that environmental liabilities of part icipating mines are reduced and not longer a potential obstacle to privatization; (b) mining companies operate in an environmental responsible manner so that subsidence and other environmentalproblems are not a thr eat to the community; (c) KW, KHW and JSW mining companies improving efficiency, adhering to a hard budget constraints and improving their balance sheets  so they meet their obligations for payments to public authorities;and (d) KW taking steps towards privatization so that the reforms can be sustained. The project is a Specific Investment Loan (SIL), with Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) features, whereby loan proceeds will be pooled wit h Government funds and used to directly supprot physical mine closure and liquidation (including dewatering) and environmental recla mation of closed mine sites.</a><br />
