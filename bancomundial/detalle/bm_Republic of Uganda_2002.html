Progress toward the PDO is measured through advancement in these key areas: 1) equipping Makerere University to provide relevant skills and competencies; 2) supporting capacity building interventions on a pilot scale in local governments; 3) supporting research and policy formulation capacity related to decentralization; and 4) assessing the impact of project interventions and drawing lessons for application. This project also supports an innovative process aimed at fostering collaboration among a number of key partners.</a><br />
