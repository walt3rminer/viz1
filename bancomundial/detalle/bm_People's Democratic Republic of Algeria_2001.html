The Project Development Objectives are to:  - set up a policy and institutional framework encouraging competition and private participation in infrastructure; - the viability of mainstreaming transport concessions through successful launching of two schemes, one as a Build-Operate-Transfer  (BOT) for the Algiers subway, the other as a concession to operate part of the port of Djendjen; - strengthen GOA's capacity to manage and regulate the transport sector; and - rehabilitate the railways to make them contribute better to cost efficient transport of people and freight nationwide.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">18000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P067567" target=_blank>In December 1999, the Government of Algeria announced its new policy and strategic objectives for the  energy and mining sectors. The main thrust of this policy is to: (i) improve efficiency in the energy and  mining sectors while securing adequate energy supplies to the economy; (ii) allow market forces to play  their respective roles; (iii) increase revenues by further developing untapped resources; (iv) address  environmental concerns; (v) promote efficient use of public resources and protect public interest; and (vi)  alleviate the financial burden of energy and mining enterprises on public finances.  The proposed project will assist the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) to implement the Government's  market-oriented reform program in the energy and mining sectors, and would particularly assist in the: (i)  separation of the role of the state, as policy maker, regulator and owner of mining resources, from its role  as owner of public enterprises, enabling these latter to become fully commercially-oriented entities; (ii)  development and implementation of a legal and institutional environment conducive to develop market  mechanism, increase competition, and private sector participation; (iii) improvement of service quality and  energy access, energy efficiency and environmental standards; and (iv) state-owned enterprises (SOEs)'  efforts to adapt to sector reforms and the new business environment. Also, the proposed project will assist  MEM in launching its first and innovative power generation plant(s) for 2000MW with private sector  participation.</a><br />
