The financial support provided through PRSO3 will help finance the costs of implementing key elements of these strategies, together with other domestic and external financing available to Government. The next proposed programmatic series of PRSO4-7 will support the Sixth National Socio-Economic Development Plan (NSEDP) which successfully incorporates the key principles of an effective Poverty Reduction Strategy and is being submitted as such at this time.   The last in a program of three PRSOs, PRSO3 focuses on three broad policy areas consistent with the goals and strategies identified by Government in its Poverty Reduction Strategy, and reflected in IDA#s Country Assistance Strategy:  (i) public resource management;  (ii) public expenditure policy; and  (iii) sustainable growth.</a><br />
