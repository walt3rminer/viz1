The  development objective of the NSDS pillar of the proposed project is to prepare a new national strategy document for statistics deve lopment that will be feasible and realistic. This will entails sectorial analyses to identify the main constraints to the statistica l system development in Djibouti and organization of workshops to discuss and disseminate the strategies among stakeholders and dono rs.2. The development objective of the National account pillar of the project:The achievements with the supports from the ADB and UNDP remain partial and preliminary. Meanwhile, the capacity of the technical staff of the DISED remains weak with the short live of  the previous training period. Securing the current achievements and further strengthening the statistical capacity in Djibouti requ ires some short and medium term efforts. Mainly:(i) the continuation of the technical team’s capacity building to engage resolutely  in sustained production of national accounts indicators; (ii) Putting in place important devices allowing the provision of relevan t inputs to the compilation of national accounts at constant prices to measure the actual performance of the economy. These include among others: enterprise statistics from the establishment of a business directory and associated indicators; indicators of economic  activity: price indexes and volume of industrial activities, index of turnover, foreign trade indices, etc; the development of the accounts for 2015 and 2016 (final accounts 2015 and provisional 2016 to the year 2017); retropolation of old series (2008-2012) usin g the new system of accounts; and publication and training in the use of classifications of activities and products.</a><br />
