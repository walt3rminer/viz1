This will be achieved through developing, pilot testing and disseminating modern models of effi cient training of skilled workers and technicians in the regional vocational education systems to support the social and economic de velopment of the regions of the Russian Federation.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">200000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P146463" target=_blank>To support St. Petersburg in (i) promoting conducive policy and the regulatory environment for the expansion of private sector enterprises; (ii) facilitating a larger and more efficient private market for land and real estate; (iii) strengthening City fiscal management capacity; and (iv) preserving and enhancing cultural assets in St. Petersburg.  The higher level objective is to enhance St Petersburg’s prospects for economic diversification and growth.  The AF will contribute to these objectives by leveraging the city’s cultural assets to sustain tourism, generate jobs and create opportunities for local businesses.  This project is to provide Additional Financing for St. Petersburg Economic Development Project to fund reconstruction of the State Mariinsky Theater and two inner courtyards of the Mikhailovsky Palace of the State Russian Museum.</a><br />

The project will comprise a WB financial intermediary loan (FIL) to participating financial institutions (PFIs) and a GEF grant to address institutional, regulatory and market barriers facing commercial financing of EE projects. Gazprombank (GPB) has been identified as a PFI.  Participation of an additional bank in the FIL will be explored during the early stages of project preparation, as well as during implementation, in the form of additional financing. A request for a US$22.73 million grant in support of the project (PIF) was submitted to GEF at the end of November. The GEF grant will aim to help GPB and other Russian banks develop EE lending business. Also, the grant will support REA in performing its EE mandate in relation to creating an environment which enables commercial financing for EE projects. The project is expected to have two main components: Component 1:  Energy Efficiency Investment Lending (Estimated cost: US$802.5 million; proposed financing: WB Loan US$300 million, GPB US$300 million, project owners/energy service companies (ESCOs) and regions/municipalities US$160 million, other banks US$40 million, GEF US$2.5 million). GEF funds under this component will be used to motivate regions and municipalities to implement their respective EE action plans and make PFI lending more attractive, the GPB lending will be blended with GEF grant funds. Specifically, it is proposed that ~US$250,000-500,000 in grant funds will be allocated to each of the initial regions or cities that agree to undertake measures within their pilot EE action plans, successfully complete them, and mobilize financing for implementation. Component 2: Technical Assistance in Support of Investment Lending (Estimated cost: US$36.7 million; proposed financing: GEF grant US$20.2 million, GPB US$12 million, REA US$4 million, regions/municipalities US$0.5 million). The main objective of component 2 is to ensure the successful implementation of component 1 and to disseminate its results in order to scale-up commercial financing of EE projects across Russia. This component will also finance project management.</a><br />

Specifically, the Project will facilitate improved efficiency of state environmental monitoring through introducing international standards of environmental monitoring, developing the existing subsystems of state environmental monitoring and integrating them into a unified information and analytical system.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">300000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P122492" target=_blank>The Project Development Objective is to improve the efficiency of energy use in Russia by scaling-up commercial lending by banks for EE investments in the industrial and public sectors. The global environmental objective is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) by scaling-up EE investments. The PDO will be achieved through combined financial and technical assistance (TA), supported by a US$500 million IBRD loan and a US$9.71 million GEF grant to GPB, and a US$13.02 million GEF grant to REA.The Project will provide assistance to three key groups of stakeholders. International experience shows that the success in enabling investments in EE dependson participation of and interactions among three groups#banks, project owners, and service and equipment providers. The Project will directly target selected representatives from all three groups. Several Russian banks will receive training and some technical assistance to develop their EE lending business, so that they could enter the market to finance EE projects. The GPB, the third largestbank in Russia, will receive an IBRD loan that will co-finance its EE credit line. A visible presence of GPB in the market of EE financing, demonstration of a viable EE lending business, and dissemination of experiences will encourage EE lending uptake by other banks.The Project will help several regions improve their EE plans and develop bankable EE subprojects. In five regions#Kaluga, Novosibirsk, Samara, Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg, GEF will support REA TA efforts to regional and municipal authorities in improving their EE programs and to several project owners in the regions in preparing bankable projects. This should boost the demand for EE services and equipment providers, while demonstrating viable procurement, contracting and financing models. National dissemination of results and lessons learned will spur on other regions, municipalities, and energy consumers to follow the example, which could help address a critical issue facing commercial financing of EE projects#the shortage of EE investment projects that are acceptable to commercial banks.</a><br />
