The project will support analytical studies and regional strategies to address the risks associated with chemical waste management. This will include stock-taking exercise of regulatory framework and institutional mechanisms that are currently used to identify, regulate and monitor environmental health risks associated with harmful chemicals and substances, such as mercury and PCBs; including analyses effectiveness of current system and identify entry points for immediate and long term interventions to address these risks. The TA will also involve assessing economics of available and innovative options for minimizing and controlling the use of hazardous chemicals and support awareness raising program on Environmental health and socio-economic consequence of unregulated hazardous chemicals and waste; Build Partnership within the Africa region for elimination and reduction of harmful chemicals and waste; and develop a regional program using various sources of funding such as IDA funding, GEF, other donors funding and commitments</a><br />

This will be achieved through: (i) carrying out perception-based surveys in selected countries on progress toward peace-building and state-building that will generate data and indicators that can be utilized by many policy actors working in these states; (ii) building communication programs to disseminate data to wide audiences in these countries and regionally; and (iii) identifying and training suitable local partners for collecting and monitoring data in these countries so that the production and communication of these indicators is sustainable over time.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</a><br />
