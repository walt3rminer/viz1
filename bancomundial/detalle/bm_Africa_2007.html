As such, this MSP would help ensure that the projects proposed for support by the already existing Investment Fund reflect the priorities of the region, as well as help promote lessons learned from the individual projects throughout the region.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P099312" target=_blank>Task Description The development site is located on the Sénégal River 200 km downstream from the Manantali hydroelectric facility, and 15 km upstream from the city of Kayes.  The site currently consists of a small-sized concrete wall spanning the width of the river, a canal approximately 10 meters wide along the river's left bank, as well as a hydroelectric station situated directly downstream from the rapids containing a Francis-type turbine.  The goal of the OMVS Félou project will be to optimally exploit the site's energy production capacity by taking advantage of the existing infrastructure as well as the area's natural attributes, such as topography and strong water flow already partially regulated by the Manantali facility.  The most recent studies demonstrate that no additional construction will be needed to raise the level of the existing wall, it will simply need to be rehabilitated and reinforced. The project is estimated to cost USD 96.9 million (the equivalent of Euro 80.5 million in 2003). The project investment cost as stated will cover the construction phase, the purchase of power generation technology, power lines and stations, environmental impact mitigation costs, and associated studies. This equates to an installed cost of USD1 ,615,000 per MW and USD0.05/kWh average cost of generation. At this price, the Félou facility will produce and supply electricity at a lower cost than the current cost of electricity produced by the national power utilities on Mali Board Schedule Comments The development site is located on the Sénégal River 200 km downstream from the Manantali hydroelectric facility, and 15 km upstream from the city of Kayes.

Increase preventative action, and reduce misconception of cross border and mobile populations, refugees, IDPs, returnees and surrounding host communities concerning HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and mitigation in selected sites in the IGAD member states; and B.

The project aims to generate scientific knowledge and develop legal and institutional capacity to implement an action plan in order to mange these fisheries for maximum economic returns, consistent with a management strategy that stresses environmental sustainability and socially equitable distribution of the benefits of exploitation. The project will adopt  an ecosystem approach which will lead to an improved understanding of transboundary and environmental influences on stock health, the life histories of key species and variability in inter-annual estimates of stock abundance.Outcomes  1)  A defensible Transboundry Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) of regional fisheries; 2)  A Strategic Action Plan (SAP) defining how each of the SWIOFP countries propose individually and collectively to address any regional issues identified. 3)  Development of institutional capacity to better manage the resources identified.  Indicators  1) Awareness raised amongst key stakeholders (Coastal States) on the TDA and; 2)  TDA recognized by the Coastal Sates; 3)  SAP approved by the contracting parties (Coastal States); 4)  Coordination and synergy established between  regional efforts; 5) Improved analysis of historical, existing and new data.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P078643" target=_blank>The project's medium to long-term global environmental goals are to reduce the risk of ship-based environmental contamination (such as oil spills from groundings and illegal discharges of ballast and bilge waters) and to strengthen the capacity of countries to respond to oil or chemical spill emergencies in the region.  The project has three specific global environmental objectives.  The first is to ascertain the economic, technical, and institutional feasibility of introducing modern aids to navigation systems in the region, such as an electronically supported marine highway, to guide ships through sensitive areas and to encourage monitoring of the movements and activities of fishing and other vessels operating within countries' territorial waters.  The second objective is to support widening the existing regional agreement (June 5, 1998) on port state control and implementation of its provisions. The third objective, focusing on Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, and Tanzania, is to reduce risks of environmental damage to beaches, fishing grounds, and other domestic resources from spills of oil and chemicals.  This will be achieved by supporting efforts of Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, and Tanzania to become part of a regional oil spill response plan, by completing the identification and mapping of environmentally sensitive areas along coasts and sea lanes, and support regional collaboration with the west Indian Ocean island states.</a><br />

These include roots and tubers in Ghana; rice in Mali; and cereals in Senegal.  The region's consumers, particularly those affected by extreme poverty, are the ultimate beneficiaries of the WAAPP.  Agricultural producers and agribusinesses, as users of the improved technology, are the primary beneficiaries of the program.  These are also the key participants, along with researchers, extension agencies and universities (in adhering to the agricultural knowledge information system (AKIS) conceptual framework), in the generation and dissemination of technology that is directly supported by the program.</a><br />
