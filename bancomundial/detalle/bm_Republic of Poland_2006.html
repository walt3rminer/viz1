<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">88800000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P065270" target=_blank>The PARSP has the following development objectives: (i) to increase social inclusion in rural underdeveloped gminas through enhancing the capacity of local governments to identify, plan, and execute social inclusion strategies through a Social Inclusion Fund (SIF); and, (ii) to support KRUS reform by improving the efficiency of the KRUS Agency through strengthening its administrative and analytic capacity and enabling better management of decision processes during its reform process.  Medium-term objectives include:  (a) quickly building rural gmina capacity in handling SIF-financed activities so that these rural gminas will be prepared to absorb similar social inclusion-focused programs which could become available under the 2007-2013 National Development Plan; and, (b) developing a targeted instrument (the SIF) for disadvantaged gminas to mitigate the potentially negative impact of future KRUS premia increases on rural families.</a><br />
