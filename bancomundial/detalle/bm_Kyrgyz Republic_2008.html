[Objective as reflected in the Financing Agreement, which in substance is not different from the PAD but wordings are different.  The most important project objectives are: a) contribute to government-wide coherent macro-economic policy development and decision making through establishing strong inter-ministerial coordination and interface; b) support process of economic policy development and implementation through enabling public institutions (and particularly the MEDT, through capacity building and restructuring) to formulate sound and analytically informed policy measure and proposals; and c) support reform of employment practices and wages in the civil service by building the capacity in a special task force in this area. [ These other main objectives are from the PAD but are not reflected in the legal agreement except item b. although broadly in line in substance ]</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">4000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P112186" target=_blank>The project objective is to improve the institutional and infrastructure environment for farmers and herders, with a strong emphasis on the livestock sector.  More specifically, the project will increase farmersâ productivity, particularlyof livestock farmers in the project areas and reduce animal diseases that have a public health impact (e.g., brucellosis).  The project will provide critical capital investments, strengthen key support services, deliver appropriate know-how, and facilitate and support effective and sustainable management of the countryâs valuable pasture resources.  This would enable farmers and herders to improve the productivity, profitability and sustainability of their enterprises and thereby help reduce poverty.  Through its specific support for a regionally focused demonstration program to control brucellosis, the project would in addition contribute significantly to improved public health.  The revised PDO is to improve the Recipient's institutional and infrastructure environment for more productive, profitable and sustainable livestock and crop production by pasture users and smallholder farmers, as well as to reduce the economic impact of the zoonotic disease burden in the human population.</a><br />
