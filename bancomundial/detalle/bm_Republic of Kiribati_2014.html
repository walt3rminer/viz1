The objective of the operations is to support the Government of K iribati in a range of key economic and fiscal reforms to move towards long-term fiscal sustainability in the context of declining revenues and successive unsust ainable drawdowns from the Revenue Equalization and Reserve Fund. The operation will provide financing to reduce reliance on unsustainable drawdowns, while supp orting reforms to improve revenue performance and expenditure quality over the m edium-term. Reforms supported by the operation will be focussed on the following  areas: i) fiscal policy, including revenue, debt management, and trust fund man agement; and ii) structural reforms, including SOE reform and telecommunications  liberalization.  The program has been discussed extensively with Government and development partn ers. The first operation was successfully delivered and is soon to disburse. ADB  will be providing additional budget support aligned with the Bank operation and  a joint donor policy matrix.  Project preparation will be financed by PREM PF3 funds. Board Schedule Comments The Board date is tentatively scheduled for late July, 2014. If progress is slow er than expected with implementation of indicative triggers, this date may need to be delayed.</a><br />
