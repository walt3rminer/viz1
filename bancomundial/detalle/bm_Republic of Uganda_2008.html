Project will specifically pilot-test a complete milk cooling system in the hands of 50 smallholders to refine user training instructions and confirm acceptability and profitability before country- or region-wide deployment. It derives from a successfully reengineered beer cooler (originally developed by a German Company) to make it applicable to milk cooling at the smallholder level. The cooler is based on vacuum and zeolite adsorption cooling technology. Along with the previously developed and tested charcoal-powered regenerator the test component will build a complete milk cooling system.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P109216" target=_blank>The overall objective of the Project is to assist the urgent implementation of the agreed demobilization and repatriation of the remaining caseload of the rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), as well as the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and other existing groups eligible for Amnesty, and assist the social and economic reintegration of former rebel combatants and collaborators into the communities to which they return, within the context of the Government of Uganda Amnesty Act of 2000. A total of 28,800 direct ex-rebel beneficiaries are targeted by the various activities, with secondary benefits expected for their families and communities. In so doing, the project would contribute to the consolidation of peace-building, reconciliation and enhanced security for the country as a whole, and its northern regions in particular.</a><br />

To achieve this, support will be provided in three main areas; (i) preparedness and prevention, (ii) outbreak response and recovery, and (iii) coordination, monitoring and evaluation.</a><br />

The PRSC has been a core element of the Bank's support for Uganda, supporting four pillars of the PEAP: Economic Management (pillar 1); Enhanced Production, Competitiveness and Incomes (pillar 2); Good Governance (Pillar 4) and Human Development (pillar 5).</a><br />
