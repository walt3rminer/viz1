Currently, the ERC is funding about 15% of GOP#s overall RHRP in the nine earthquake affected districts of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and the State of Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK).  The GoP, through its letter of August 2006, has requested additional funds to meet an estimated financing gap of US$ 500 million for RHRP.</a><br />

This would be achieved by: (a) deepening and broadening the institutional reforms that are already underway in Sindh; (b) improving the irrigation system in a systematic way covering key hydraulic infrastructure, main and branch canals, and distributaries and minors; and (c) enhancing long-term sustainability o f irrigation system through participatory irrigation management and developing institutions for improving operation and maintenance of the system and cost recovery. The improved water management would lead to increased agricultural production, employment and incomes over some about 1.8 million ha or more than 30 percent o f the irrigated area in Sindh, and one of the poorest regions o f the country.</a><br />

To take advantage of the existence of such a clear plan, the task team proposes to use a programmatic approach employing a single category of expenditures (i.e., LHW salaries). The project would disburse semi-annually, over 3 years, against accomplishment of agreed prior actions. Agreed actions by approval could include the contracting out of the management of the program in selected districts and the recruitment of a monitoring and evaluation firm. Subsequent actions could include signing MOUs with district governments regarding devolution of the LHW program and implementation of the performance incentive. It is envisaged that upon approval, 10% of the funds would be released retroactively (i.e., the maximum allowed) to pay for salaries. During preparation, prior actions for approval and reforms for year one will be agreed. Year two and three reforms actions would be agreed during semi-annual review missions. The current version of the PC-I includes the following areas of reform: (i)   Improving the Performance of LHWs Through New Approaches to Management: In order to make large improvements in the LHW program at the district level, managerial and organizational innovations that emphasize measurable results/outputs rather than inputs will be tested on an appropriately large scale (a few districts). The types of approaches envisaged include: (i) contracting out to NGOs the management of the whole LHW program in some poorly performing districts, including where NGOs are currently managing the BHUs (e.g., Rahim Yar Khan and other districts in the Punjab); (ii) "contracting in" individual managers to run the LHW program in other districts on performance-based contracts awarded on a competitive basis; (iii) providing performance-based bonuses to government staff who manage the district LHW program; and (iv) devolving the management of the program to district governments in some poorly and well performing districts (about four of each). This will involve building the capacity of district managers before the program funds are provided to the district government. The outcome of each innovation will be evaluated rigorously by third parties and decisions would then be made about which should be expanded. (ii)   Broadening the Scope of Services Provided by LHWs: The in-depth evaluation of the LHW program found that LHWs were not overworked (they worked about 20 hours per week on average) and that they could, in fact, provide more services to their communities. The PC-I calls for the careful introduction of effective, scientifically proven, low cost, and appropriate interventions that could have a large health impact. New interventions could include: (i) expanding use of iodized salt; (ii) promotion of hand-washing to reduce diarrhea and pneumonia; (iii) more effective forms of health education and other demand side innovations; and (iv) directly involving LHWs in tuberculosis control. These innovations will generally be introduced on a pilot basis and their feasibility tested before implementation is expanded. (iii)   Strengthening Support Functions for LHWs: The PC-I also calls for improving the efficiency of procurement and distribution of drugs, contraceptives, and other supplies that the LHWs need in the field through contracts with private firms. In addition, there will also be efforts to improve pre-service and in-service training of LHWs through mechanisms that link actual knowledge and skills of the trainees to payment of the trainers. The LHW program will also explore means for improving the efficiency of field supervision through the introduction of job-aids and improved training of supervisors.

Phase I was supported under a series of three programmatic Development Policy Credits (DPCs) from 2004-2006. The objectives of the Phase II PESRP are to improve performance and quality of school education to improve student learning outcomes; improve school participation and retention rates; and reduce gender and regional disparities (grades 1-10). The Phase II reform program is based on the following three pillars:   (A) Enhance fiscal sustainability and improve the fiduciary environment to: (i)  ensure that public expenditure continues to be increased for education at both provincial and district levels in accordance with sector needs; (ii)  strengthen the districts# financing capacity and ensure that adequate resources are transferred to districts to meet education needs; (iii) increase transparency of financial management and procurement processes and practices; and (iv) strengthen provincial and district capacities to monitor financial flows.  (B) Increase equitable access to education and improve quality and relevance of education. This forms the core reform agenda. Access agenda focuses on programs to: (i) increase participation, retention and completion rates, especially for girls; and (ii) encourage the participation of private sector.  The quality agenda seeks to: (i) improve school performance and student learning outcomes; and (ii) improve quality of learning through better teaching practices, better textbooks and a credible examination system.  (C) Improve public education sector governance and management to: (i) strengthen sector planning and policy development capacity of the provincial education department; (ii) strengthen district education departments# management and monitoring capacity; (iii) strengthen monitoring and evaluation to gauge education sector performance; and (iv) enhance school based management, and monitoring of school performance by communities.</a><br />

Key pillars of the ISRP are (i) Institutional and policy reforms to improve the management and maintenance of the irrigation system to ensure its long term sustainability; (ii) Water resources management reforms to make intra-province water allocation and distribution more transparent; (iii) Irrigation service delivery reforms to improve the quality, efficiency and accountability with which irrigation services are delivered; and (iv) Reforms to improve water use efficiency and on-farm productivity.</a><br />
