To achie ve this objective, the project would: (i) assist Eritrea rapidly to rebuild key physical and social infrastructure (bridges, health  clinics, schools, water supply facilities; (ii) help displaced and drought-affected people rebuild their lives and resume their eco nomic activities, through the provision of urgent inputs such as tools, seeds, shelter items, as well as employment opportunities; ( iii) rehabilitate the private sector through the provision of line of credit; and (iv) assist the Government to maintain macro econo mic stability through balance of payment support.  A Supplemental Grant was approved in June 2003 to mitigate the effects of the drought and fulfill the project's objectives of long t erm reconstruction and economic recovery, through continued interventions in agriculture, social protection, and infrastructure reha bilitation.</a><br />
