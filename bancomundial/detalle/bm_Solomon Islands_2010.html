The Project will support the development of a new regulatory institution#the Telecommunications Commission#designed to promote good governance in the sector. Further, through support for enabling infrastructure, the Project will pave the way for more widespread application of information communication technologies (ICT) supporting economic and social development, including greater opportunities for women.</a><br />
