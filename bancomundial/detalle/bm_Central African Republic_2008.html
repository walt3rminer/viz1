The proposed grant focuses on two main policy areas: (i) strengthening public finance management; and (ii) improving public sector and economic governance. This operation directly supports two pillars of the PRSP: (i) promoting good governance and the rule of law (pillar 2); and (ii) rebuilding and diversifying the economy (pillar 3). In addition, it will assist the Government in attaining some of the HIPC Completion Point triggers and will provide much needed external resources to ensure timely payment of public sector salaries and external debt service.</a><br />
