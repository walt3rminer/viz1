The series is structured around two pillars aligned to the Government&rsquo;s national strategy on climate change. Actions under Pillar 1 seek to strengthen the national policy and institutional framework for climate resilient planning - including reforms that will strengthen institutional coordination, monitoring and reporting.&nbsp; Actions under Pillar 2 seek to strengthen the climate resilience of selected sectors &ndash; including reforms in agriculture (considered particularly vulnerable to climate risks), roads and energy. This pillar also includes a reform that will strengthen hydro-meteorological services to contribute to disaster risk reduction and management, and to improve early warning systems. The reforms selected for support address key poverty issues &ndash; including the resilience of smallholder farmers to short-term weather risks and longer-term climate change, and access to effective early warning systems, as well as sustainability issues - including climate resilience of infrastructure, energy efficiency and renewable energy access.The operation&nbsp;was the second, single tranche operation ina series of three climate change Development Policy Operations (DPOs). The first two operations (CC DPO 1 and CC DPO 2) delivered US$50 million each of IDA financing in support of a medium-term reform program across several sectors. The reform agenda was consistent with the objective of the country&rsquo;s poverty reduction support strategy (PARP) and is now aligned with the new 5 year plan (2015-2019). Reforms are aligned closely with the National Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Strategy or  Estrat&eacute;giaNacional de Adapta&ccedil;&atilde;o e Mitiga&ccedil;&atilde;o das Mudancas Clim&aacute;ticas.&nbsp; </em></a><br />

Pillar III promotes the development of money, debt, and capital markets. The series has two single tranche operations and this is the first operation. It is 50percent IDA Credit and 50 percent IDA Grant with US$25 million equivalent.  The results indicators (elaborated further in the ISR)for the three Pillars are:  Pillar I: (i) percentage of banks classifying their Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) according to the new regulation; (ii) percentage of banks implementing the new risk management guidelines; (iii) percentage of deposits balances and accountscovered by the Deposit Guarantee Fund (DGF); (iv) criminalization of terrorism financing.
