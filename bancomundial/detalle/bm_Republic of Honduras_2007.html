<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">9000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P105386" target=_blank>The objective of the Project is to improve the capacity to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters at the municipal level.  i) To develop capacity in national agencies to gather, analyze and disseminate information, and to provide technical assistance so that they can assist local governments in disaster management; and ii) To promote disaster vulnerability reduction in highly vulnerable municipalities. This would include: disaster preparedness, risk analysis and vulnerability mapping, preparation of preventive land use plans, identification of mitigation measures leading to development of feasibility studies, design of priority mitigation works, and small mitigation works. The difference between the original development objectives and the development objective, as stated in the amendment, is that with the small mitigation works the project is taking a complete approach to reduce the vulnerability at local level, from the analysis, studies, and design to the small works.</a><br />
