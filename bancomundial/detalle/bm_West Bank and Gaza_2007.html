<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P082230" target=_blank>The objective of the project is to design and implement a unified public sector pension system, including modernization of the administration of asset management, benefits and payment administration, and initiation of prudential governance standards.   The project is to enable the PA to put its pension schemes for government workers on a financially sustainable basis. It will do this by unifying and rationalizing the benefits from the two civil service schemes and by creating a new scheme for the security  services. This will strengthen the fiscal position of the PA by reducing the pressure on government finances of current pension arrangements. It will reduce future deficits, and facilitate more efficient government operation by allowing the PA to retire staff over age 60.</a><br />
