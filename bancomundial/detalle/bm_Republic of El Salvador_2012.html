The grant will assist poor farmers living in the dry eastern region adapt their farming practices to better cope with drought, food insecurity, and high and volatile prices of agricultural and energy inputs. The farmers have been affected by the global crisis which severely contracted the economy, and which was only partly mitigated by a temporary safety net mostly for vulnerable urban poor. These farmers are increasingly more vulnerable as their traditional agricultural practices are becoming less productive as a result of climate changes and more costly as a result of the price volatilitiesof their essential inputs caused by the global crisis.</a><br />
