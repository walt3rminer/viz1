In 2008 the GoM announced that it will extend the PARPA II by one year to include 2010, thereby strengthening sustainability and continuity with the next strategic document.  PARPA II is mainly focused on shared growth and on the need for decentralization. Within this context, PRSC-5 is expected to help the GoM in: (a) the consolidation and deepening of the institutional reforms in the area of macroeconomic management; (b) reforms in governance by supporting decentralization to enhance public investments and service delivery at the provincial and district level, and by supporting public sector reform; and (c) economic development by removing constraints to growth, such as infrastructure, and promoting agricultural growth. The PRSC-5 also supports the implementation of the Government policy response to the higher global food and fuel prices.</a><br />
