The aim of the Pilot is to test new approaches and civilian implementation m odalities that should improve the socio-economic reintegration experience of former combatants. If the project is deemed successful,  the government will have at its disposal a set of social and economic support processes, and an implementation arrangement with sys tems and procedures that it can draw upon in the future. At the same time, would-be former combatants will have better prospects for  a viable return to civilian livelihoods, a clearer understanding of reintegration support they can expect, and a better understandi ng of how and by whom it will be delivered.</a><br />
