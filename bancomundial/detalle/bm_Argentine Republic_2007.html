Through improved services the Project aims to support the return to a sustainable path of economic growth, to alleviate poverty and to increase social equity. To this end, the Province prioritized a set of interventions through the sector wide Infrastructure Program for the period 2005-2012 specifically aimed to: i.    Develop a multi-year public expenditure program, in line with the priorities of the Province, to implement the InfrastructureProgram following sound fiscal policies to ensure convergencetowards a long-term sustainable fiscal framework. ii.    Improve and maintain high priority segments of the non-concessioned paved road network to support the reactivation of the provincial economy and strengthen regional competitiveness. iii.    Enhance access to water, sewerage, sanitation and urban drainage services, especially for the low-income segments of the population living in highly vulnerable areas of the Conurbano Bonaerense.  The specific Project Development Objective is to improve the social and environmental welfare of approximately 5,000,000 people through the improved provision of transport, water and sanitation and drainage services.</a><br />
