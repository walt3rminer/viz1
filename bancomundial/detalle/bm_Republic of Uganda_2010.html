<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P124986" target=_blank>The objective is to bring together infoDev's experience with ICT-enabled innovation and entrepreneurship, in particular its African network of business incubators, with Nokia's expertise on mobile applications in emerging markets in order to extend mobile applications in Africa. The expected impact is to increase the number of mobile applications entrepreneurs in Africa.  The expected intermediate results are the hosting of events (around 30 in four cities in the first 18 months of the project) to promote innovation in the mobile sphere, targeting around 1000 participants from 400 or so companies, NGOs, government agencies and other organizations that would participate in the online and offline activities, and promoting the visibility of the African chapters at a global level, for instance through a dedicated webspace and competitions with winners to gain entry to international events, such as infoDev's Global Forum for Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Helsinki (May/June 2011). The main knowledge output of this activity will be inputs to the Mobile Flagship Report (GLO 1 under TF071399) to evaluate lessons learned from this experiment in social networking and to show the development potential of mobile applications.</a><br />

Within this the programme has three broad objectives: Objective 1: At least 50,000 slum dwellers living within the 5 selected municipalities actively engage in both securing their rights and honouring their responsibilities through improved urban governance and formalisation. Objective 2: At least 50,000 slum dwellers living within the 5 selected municipalities improve their qualitative and quantitative access to municipal services. Objective 3: The Government of Uganda (national and sub national) in partnership with interested stakeholders develops effective and efficient inclusive urban development policies and strategies enabling the better management of future urban growth positively affecting the lives of 200,000 slum dweller households nationwide.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P121015" target=_blank>The major aim of this proposal is to formulate a national urban policy and a Strategic Urban Development Plan for the period 2010 - 2025 that will provide the necessary framework to guide and manage the urbanization process to ensure effective management of the expected urban growth. The primary focus of the policy and the strategic plan will be to enhance competitiveness of the urban sector in order to harness its potential as a driver of economic growth. The policy will address the inherent urban challenges facing Uganda. It will articulate strategies to address the current policy, legal, institutional and financial sector constraints to improve urban sector planning, development and management, service delivery, livelihood and urban governance. Furthermore, it will provide appropriate strategies to promote social harmony and inclusiveness of all segments of society and above all develop a vision for the management of urban growth. The Strategic Urban Development Plan will contain an agreed national vision and provide specific actionable directions for the urban sector. Specific Objectives a)   To assess and analyze the performance of urban centres in Uganda in terms of service delivery, environmental sustainability, land use and infrastructure, housing, social development, urban economy, financing of urban development and management as well as urban governance. b)   To engage key stakeholders in a participatory planning manner to build consensus in the preparation and adoption of a national urban policy as well as a strategic urban development plan (2010 - 2025) for Uganda. c)   To develop an Education, Information and Communication (EIC) Strategy to increase awareness among a cross section of stakeholders  to enable them effectively participate in the process of policy development from an informed position about the need for orderly urban development and effective management. d)   To develop GIS capability to develop, institutionalize and maintain the National Urban Indicators as effective tools for monitoring and managing urban development. e)   To promote partnerships among various actors in the urban sector for purposes of enhancing mobilization of resources and capacities for implementation of urban policy and the strategic urban development plan. f)   To explore various sources of financing Urban Development and make appropriate recommendations to facilitate implementation of the Urban Policy and strategic Urban Development Plan.</a><br />
