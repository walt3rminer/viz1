The specific objective of the program is to increase short term employment opportunities and to improve employability and incomes of targeted youth.  The program seeks to address constraints on the demand and supply side of the labor market namely: (i) to improve technical capacity and promote creation and/or expansion of small youth owned enterprises in economically viable activities; (ii) to improve skills base of young people to make them more employable; and (iii) to provide a safety net and income supplement for the most vulnerable youth through public works.  The program will be scaling up ongoing interventions to increase number of beneficiaries and expand geographic coverage.  The project will pay particular attention to learning from its experiences through impact evaluations designed around different interventions.  Finally, the program is expected to reduce social pressures and the risk of conflict by providing employment support to about 30,000-35,000 vulnerable youth over a period of three years.</a><br />

When completed the Project will consist of:(a) an 88 m high rockfill dam (approx. 2.5 million cubic meters of granite rock); (b) two "morning glory" spillways; (c) two outlet tunnels of approx. 620 m length from the inlet to the outlet structure. The left tunnel will be used as discharge for the main spillway, while the right tunnel will normally be used  as a power tunnel to supply water to the two power turbines of 25 MW each. For inflows in excess of 1000 cubic meters per second, the right tunnel also serves as an auxiliary spillway; (d a power house,where the Project's electromechanical works, controls and related equipment are located; and  (e) a 200 km long 161 kV transmission line from the hydropower site with Freetown,where a161/33 kV substation is located. In addition, the Project will fund environmental managemnt and resettlement/management components. In addition, the Project will fund appropriate studies/panels to enable compliance with the World Bank's safeguard policies including: (i) the update of the environmental assessment; (ii) the preparation of a resettlement action plan(RAP); (iii) the convening of a dam safety panel; and (v)convening of an environmental experts panel. Finally,TA will be provided through: (a) supporting the financing of local experts (primarily environmental) to be hired by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU): (b) appointing an international hydropower expert to assist the PIU manage the Project; and (c) appointing an international consulting company to supervise the completion of the Project.</a><br />
