Focusing on strategic areas, the project will have the following three distinct capacity building objectives:  1) broad-based professional development of public sector officers 2) capacity enhancement in key ministries/agencies 3)strengthening of regulatory agencies</a><br />

The development objective for the proposed project is to improve maternal and child health outcomes through: (i) improved access to promotive, preventive, and curative services at the community level particularly to women and children (as measured by, for example, a 20% increase in immunization coverage, 10% increase in contraceptive prevalence, and 15% increase in skilled birth attendance, etc.); and (ii) dramatically improved delivery of these services in poor and underserved areas (as measured by increased coverage and decreased variance in the above indicators within and between districts). The achievement of the development objectives will be measured through district-level household surveys (being financed from other sources) as well as special studies and project records. 2.   The project would comprise the following three components: 3.   Improving the Performance of LHWs Through New Approaches to Management: In order to make large improvements in the LHW program in poorly performing districts, a number of managerial and organizational innovations that emphasize measurable results/outputs rather than inputs will be tested on a large scale. The types of approaches envisaged include: (i) contracting out management of the whole LHW program in some poorly performing districts to NGOs using performance-based contracts that specify measurable improvements in service delivery and in which NGOs are selected on a competitive basis; (ii) contracting in. individual managers to run the LHW program in other districts on performance-based contracts also awarded on a competitive basis; and (iii) providing performance-based bonuses to government staff who manage the district LHW program. (The LHW program provided bonuses to managers in the past but these were not directly related to performance.) This component will also support the devolution of the program to selected districts. To be consistent with the ongoing devolution of authority to local governments for the delivery of social services, the Government wants to gradually shift the responsibility and financing of the LHW program to the district governments. Hence, the project will provide funds to accomplish this in high performing districts where the LHW program is already well established. Two possible approaches will be explored; (i) a series of matching grants from the federal government to the local government where the degree of matching is linked to performance of the program and improvements in service delivery; or (ii) a formal contractual mechanism between the federal, provincial, and local governments which would closely resemble contracts with NGOs. A modest amount of funds will be used to strengthen the management of the LHW program at all levels. 4.   Broadening the Scope of Services Provided by LHWs: The in-depth evaluation of the LHW program found that LHWs were not overworked and that they could, in fact, provide more services to their communities. The project will support the careful introduction of effective, scientifically proven, low cost, and appropriate interventions that could have a large health impact. The types of new interventions could include: (i) providing LHWs with additional types of contraceptives; (ii) point of use dis-infection of drinking water and promotion of hand-washing to reduce diarrhea; (iii) more effective forms of health education and other demand side innovations; and (iv) new approaches to the care of neonates. Extensive discussions will be held with other sectors, including education, water, and sanitation on what other interventions could be added the LHWs. tasks. These innovations will generally be introduced on a pilot basis and their feasibility tested before implementation is expanded. In order to effectively monitor and evaluate the various approaches being tested and to measure the achievement of the development objectives, the project will further strengthen the evaluation capacity of the LHW program either directly</a><br />

This coupled with the chronic need for affordable housing across all income segments and the institutional realization that private consumption has the highest effect on the GDP has spurred the activity in the housing finance realm. In spite of the fiscal landscape the enabling environment is still lacking. The perceived project plans to deal with certain aspects of the equation that will make housing finance an attractive option for all stake holders.</a><br />
