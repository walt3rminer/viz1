The proposed implementing agency for this component would be the MoF.

UNDP/UNCDF/Swedish Government have already committed USD 3 million to this component.

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">60000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P106540" target=_blank>The Government of Nepal has introduced a program of guaranteed employment for the poorest and worst affected districts starting with 5 districts in the Karnali zone. Preliminary estimates show that while the program was well-conceived and has just taken off, it is severely under-funded in relation to the need.  Moreover, the program is limited to just 5 districts.  Under this operation, the Bank would support the Government to extend the program to 24 districts in the first instance, and fill the funding gap.  Under the Bank-supported program, high priority will be accorded to realizing two goals: (a) generate quick employment opportunities to target communities, and (b) create socio-economic micro infrastructure that is of immediate relevance to communities as per the wishes of the target communities.  Financing would be channeled through the budget and the ERL would disburse against an agreed positive list.</a><br />
