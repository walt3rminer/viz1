In addition to the proposed IDA credit, several donors including IDA, EU, SIDA, DfID, CEB and relevant UN agencies, will through coordinated but parallel financed operations, support the Government initiatives in this area.  The overall project objective is to promote the Government's program to increase access to quality and efficient health services with the aim of decreasing premature mortality and disability for the local population and improve the targeting of social transfers and services to the poor in line with the MTEF for 2007-2009.</a><br />
