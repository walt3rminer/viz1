It illustrates the levels and st ages through which an intern audit activity can evolve as it defines, implements, measures, controls and improves its processes andp ractices. The IA-CM provides a road map for continuous improvement in processes and practices to establish effective internal auditi ng in an organization. There are 5 capability levels in IA-CM, where level 1 is the lowest with no sustainability and high depende ncy on individual efforts and level 5 is the inspirational level. Level 3 is where internal audit management and professional practi ces are uniformly applied and the practice generally conforms to the internal audit standards and an established Quality AssuranceIm provement Program (QAIP) . Level 3 of IA-CM requires advisory services and performance audit to be practiced uniformly and the use  of risk based audit plan within the internal audit institutions. To ensure such internal audit professional practice, qualified IA- CM accessors and certified QAIP reviewers should be available to support such transformation.</a><br />
