The current cycle of PRSCs is a vehicle for IDA, and the international partner community more broadly, to support a country that has undergone macroeconomic instability and is suffering from the effects of the global financial crisis. This support is all the more important as it helps finance the government#s fiscal stimulus package to counter the adverse effects of the global crisis and limit the depth of growth slow down, so that the poverty-reduction reforms can stay on track.  The government has a strong track record of economic growth and poverty reduction.  The proposed operation comprises policy actions in areas such as state-owned enterprise reform, financial sector reform, the social sectors, climate change, public administration and legal development.  This comprehensive program, with the same broad coverage as the SEDP 2006-2010, provides the foundation for sustained growth, social inclusion, environmental sustainability and improved governance. The preparation of the proposed operation, like previous operations in this cycle, helped improve the content of strategically important policy actions, to ensure the timeliness of their adoption, and to monitor the impact of the overall progress toward development outcomes.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">100000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P107062" target=_blank>Project Development Objective (Note: will be disclosed in the MOS) Objectives:  The proposed Credit, the second in a programmatic series of three such operations over the five-year period 2007-2011, would support policy and institutional actions to improve the results of one of Vietnam's principal National Target Programs (NTP) for poverty reduction: the re-designed 'Program for Socio-Economic Development in Communes Facing Extreme Hardship in Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas (2006-2010)', more commonly known as 'Program 135, Phase 2' (P135-2). It would continue to support the reform program being supported under the First P135-2 Support Operation, approved by the Board in March 2007. This program offers the best-available entry point for constructive engagement in a strategically important area of policy for Vietnam: how to adapt policies to better address the challenge of reducing poverty among ethnic minority groups who are disporportionately represented among the poor in Vietnam.  Lending instrument and rationale for joint IDA/ donor support:  The proposed Credit would be the second in a series of single-tranche, development policy-based operations intended to provide a vehicle for the World Bank and the wider donor community jointly to engage the Government of Vietnam in this NTP reform agenda. Budget support would be provided to help sustain the implementation of critical improvements in the design and implementation of P135-2 in a phased manner over the life of the program. Design draws on the demonstrated results from directly relevant, community-development projects supported by the World Bank and other donors that may be readily be applied under P135-2 and other NTPs and thereby significantly improve their results and effectiveness. Critical elements of this reform agenda have already been demonstrated at scale under ongoing World Bank- and other ODA-supported initiatives in Vietnam. The First Joint Progress Review of P135-2 was conducted in May-June 2007 and has confirmed the utility of this lending modality for constructive engagement in this strategically important policy area.

The development objective of the proposed project would be achieved through: (a) major upgrading and /or expansion of rural power networks in about 1200 communes; (b) conversion of current ad-hoc local electricity management systems to local distribution utilities (LDUs) as legal entities recognized under Vietnamese law, to improve management of power distribution in rural areas, improve financial sustainability, and better enable future mobilization of private funds; and (c) capacity building assistance for the LDUs, provincial authorities, participating regional power companies, and national authorities involved in the planning and regulation of rural electrification. The proposed project would improve access to energy to about 2 million households in Vietnam, including many living in some of the poorest communes. The project also will enable supply of large increases in electric power for expanding productive uses in rural areas, alleviating a major constraint to local economic growth.</a><br />
