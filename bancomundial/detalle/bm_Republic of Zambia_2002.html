<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">50000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P080612" target=_blank>The overall objectives of the project are to assist the government in maintaining key commitments to its economic and investment priorities laid out in the PRSP while meeting the exigencies of the food crisis, and to help restore productive capability of the affected population. It is aimed at helping the government to respond effectively to the current drought, and to supplement government's effort and resources: (a) to prevent starvation and malnutrition in the affected human population; (b) to support other identified drought mitigation measures such as providing drinking water, improving critical transport and logistics links, supporting health and sanitation services, providing support to keep children in school and protecting the threatened livestock population; (c) to support farmers to raise crops in the next agricultural season; and (d) to enhance government capacity for longer-term disaster management, including through support for developing an effective early warning system. There has been no change in the risk profile of the project to undermine the achiement of the Development Objectives.</a><br />

The project therefore has four components:  1. Investment banking, legal, and other specialist advisory services to support the PRIVATIZATION OF ZCCM;  2. Technical support for the PRIVATIZATION program (for non-ZCCM parastatals) managed by the Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA);  3. Technical assistance, equipment, and training for the MINISTRY OF MINES AND MINERALS DEVELOPMENT - Completed;  4. Technical assistance to the Legislative Drafting Department of the MINISTRY OF LEGAL AFFAIRS - completed.</a><br />

The miombo is of outstanding international importance for the conservation of flora and fuana, many of which are endemic to the region. In response to the highly acidic soils of the miombo woodlands, the traditional farming system is the slash and burn where vegetation is removed from between 2-3 ha by farmers and burnt in plots averaging 0.3-0.4 ha. The ashes increase the ph of the soils and are a source of additional nutrients. This system supports a period of cultivation of up to 5 years. However, rapid population growth is increase pressure on land and progressively shortening the period of fallow. Decline in soil fertility has led to food insecurity. The rapid degradation of the soil is also of global concern. The project is intended to promote a shift from slash and burn to more sustainable land management practices which have been successfully tried in other areas. These practices include the application of conservation farming (CF) at the farm level and integrated ecosystem management (IEM). Examples of CF are crop rotation, no- or minimum tillage, use of agricultural lime and the use of crop cover crops. IEM measures includes community fire control and agroforestry. The vehicle that will be used in the promotion of these practices is the succesfully tested Farmer Field Schools.</a><br />
