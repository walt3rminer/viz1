<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">11000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P078991" target=_blank>The overall APL program development objective, as approved by the IDA Board in 1998, is to improve health outcomes in Nicaragua, particularly among the poor, by raising the efficiency, effectiveness, equity and sustainability of the Nicaraguan health system. In this second phase of the APL, IDA financing will contribute, alongside funds from the MOH and other SWAp partners, to improve maternal and child health in the poorest municipalities of Nicaragua, concentrating roughly half of the Nicaragua?s poor. By improving the health status of this population, health inequities should reduce, as shown by disparities in maternal and infant mortality indicators across geographical areas and income groups. These goals will be achieved through the operationalization of three strategic objectives, as set up in the sector Five-Year Implementation Plan, namely: (i) the extension of coverage of  a package of basic health and nutrition services to the poorest areas of the country, via the new integrated model of health care; (ii) the physical and functional strengthening of the health service facilities network, focusing on maternal-infant care, so as to provide a seamless path of essential services in the target areas; and (iii) institutional strengthening and capacity-building, concentrated specifically on developing the purchasing, monitoring and evaluation capacities of the MOH, its leadership role to enhancing donors? alignment and harmonization, and the management capacity of MOH decentralized units and Autonomous Governments of the Atlantic Coast.</a><br />
