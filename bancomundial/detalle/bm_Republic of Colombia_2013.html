The proposed objective of the Project is to reduce the risk of urban flooding in target areas of Barranquilla#s eastern watershed. The PDO will be measured by tracking: i) percentage of streets in target areas that have drainage systems with  a determined flood design return period, ii) population living and working in risk-prone areas, iii) number of drainage inlets that are impeded due to solid waste in target areas. Description of Project Components of proposed project: Component 1: Flood Risk Identification and Awareness  1.1 Stormwater Drainage Master Planning: The outputs of the feasibility study of technical solutions will contribute to the definition of a Stormwater Drainage Master Plan with strong linkages to urban and transport planning that will guide the sequencing and nature of physical interventions required across the city. 1.2 Flood Risk Knowledge: This involves studies for completing flood hazard identification, vulnerability and risk assessments (for example, probability of loss of life and property if the vulnerability is not addressed).  1.3 Education and Information Campaigns: The importance of risk mitigation and disaster preparedness will be introduced at various levels of the educational system and will involve the development and implementation of a multifaceted public information campaign improving public awareness of urban flooding and of roles and responsibilities of individual households and communities. Component 2: Flood Risk Reduction Based on the Stormwater Drainage Master Plan and flood risk mapping undertaken in Component 1, this component would initiate the first phase of physical interventions with investments in selected micro-basins.  2.1 Structural solutions: Current best management practice for high-impact and cost-effective solutions for flood mitigation is to retard peak flows in upstream/midstream areas by focusing on retention and detention. Such measures are high-impact as they slow the transfer time by capturing large volumes of water and utilize areas of infiltration. This component would therefore include detailed diagnostics of each #arroyo# with the objective of defining the appropriate portfolio of response measures to promote hydraulic capacity and reduce run-off levels following rain events by increasing water capture, making use of above- and below-ground storage, and promoting infiltration rates. Investments would be focused on identification and assessment of potential infrastructure and complementary alternatives. Investments would be focused on potential infrastructure alternatives and involve construction of selected options to promote hydraulic capacity and reduce run-off levels following rain events, including but not limited to canalization, pipes, culverts, pedestrian bridges, or use of Low-Impact Development (LID) solutions (i.e., pervious pavement). 2.2 Non-structural solutions: Some of the contributing causes to the urban flooding in Barranquilla include blocking of the flood path as a result of litter and sediment deposition, and private properties (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial) draining run-off directly onto city streets. Similarly, flood risk is increased by the presence of homes, businesses, and infrastructure in high-risk zones adjacent to the arroyos. This component would therefore focus on environmental mitigation measures such as assessing potential use of green infrastructure, improving solid waste collection/management practices,  and evaluating potential application of incentive mechanisms (i.e., property tax credits/subsidies) for implementation of run-off reducing measures (e.g., rainwater capture, green roofs, pervious driveways).

The delivery of the ERs accord ing to the delivery schedule agreed upon in the Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) will be the results indicator that is g oing to be monitored by the World Bank over time.</a><br />

The overall objective is to increase the competitiveness of small holder agriculture in Colombia. The project will build upon the success of the Rural Productive Alliance II  in order to scale up the investments to support small holders so that they can participate  in high value chains and enter into contractual arrangements with buyers (agribusinesses, exporters and supermarkets).  The project will purport to make the approach sustainable by involving the agroindustries and the rural financial institutions.  In addition, project identification will emphasize the various areas that  require public investments to improve the  competitiveness of the value chains that benefit small holders (for example agricultural innovation adoption, risk management, etc.).</a><br />
