The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (Report No. 38326-MW) envisages that over a period of three years, there could be a series of three proposed annual Development Policy Credits. This Grant#s reform program selectively supports efforts by the Government in the following areas: (i) functioning of agricultural markets with a focus on the establishment of additional auction floors for agricultural products, and having in place a better targeted and more private sector inclusive system of providing fertilizers and seeds to farmers; (ii) improving the business environment through the establishment of a commercial court; (iii) economic governance with a focus on reforms that improve payroll management and external financial accountability of the GoM.</a><br />
