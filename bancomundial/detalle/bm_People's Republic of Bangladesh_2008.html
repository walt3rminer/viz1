The overall objective of the long-term program is to support GOB's strategy to improve national agricultural productivity and farm income by revitalizing the national agricultural technology system.  It is too early to make an assessment about whether the development objectives would be achieved during the lifetime of this project.  However, the Government ownership and commitment is strong and the necessary implementation arrangements are being put in place.  The satisfactory ratings are standard for first review and these will be assessed during the next implementation support mission.</a><br />
