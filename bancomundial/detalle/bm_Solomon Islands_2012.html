<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">2000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P126740" target=_blank>The proposed grant is the first in a series of two development policy operations in support of Solomon Islands’ transition from post-conflict recovery to sustainable development in the context of its National Development Strategy (NDS).  The proposed operation would support the following three development objectives:i) improve the quality of public financial management; ii) improve the financial management of key State Owned Enterprises; and iii) improve extractive revenue transparency.  The proposed operation is fully aligned with the objectives set out in the most recent World Bank Interim Strategy Note (ISN) to:  (I.a.) address fiscal and balance of payments pressures through the provision of financing and through the attendant participation in the policy dialogue; (II.c.) update the mining sector regulatory and institutional framework and seek participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI); and (III.c.) improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and planning in public spending. The overarching themes throughout are public sector effectiveness and accountability.</a><br />
