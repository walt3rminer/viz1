<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">40000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P075994" target=_blank>The developmental objective of the WAPP APL 1project is to increase access of WAPP "Zone A" coastal states (Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria and Togo) to more stable and reliable electricity as a means to alleviate power supply deficits and/or to reduce their collective vulnerability to drought-induced power supply disruptions.  This developmental objective is to be achieved by: (a) implementinga WAPP Cooperation Agreement to facilitate enhanced cross-border power exchanges between the four concerned Transmission System Operators (TSOs), namely CEB, CIE, NEPA and VU; and (b) establishing and fully deploying the  cross-border electricity transfer capabilities of the proposed 330kV WAPP Coastal Transmission Backbone.    Outcomes  The expected outcomes include:  1. Increasing cross-border electricity trade between WAPP "Zone A" Coastal States;  2.  Reductions in power transfer losses in the principal transmission networks of the  WAPP "Zone A" coastal states;  3.  More cost efficient coverage of peak power demand through economy power  exchanges between WAPP "Zone A" coastal states.  The WAPP APL 1 project would be considered successful if it provides ample capacity  for unconstrained cross-border electricity trade between the five ECOWAS Member States for up to at least 2020.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P094724" target=_blank>We have been working with the GEF to develop a "Medium Size Project" to monitor atmospheric deposition of macronutrients (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus).  Why is this important to African countries?  All of the data from GEF projects on African lakes (including Lake Victoria, Lake Malawi, and Lake Tanganyika) indiate that the eutrophication process (over-enrichment leading to fish kills, algae blooms making it more difficult for humans to use the water, and water hyacinth growth, etc.) is coming from deposition of these "fertilizer-elements" on the lake surface and not from surface runoff and organic polllution from cities (although these are of secondary importance). The GEF has now given us $50,000 to prepare this Medium Size Project (which will consist of $1 million from the GEF and another million from other bilateral sources).  Kenya is the benericiary of the $50,000 PDF-A grant and has agreed to shoulder the responsibiility of organizing and hosting the regional workshop to prepare the atmospheric deposition monitoring program.  Dr. Eric Odada at the University of Nairobi is our contact person and the one to do the organizing.  We expect that there will be 9 countries participating in the workshop and associated Medium Size Project.  These countries are those that extend from west to east across Equatorial Africa. There is no BB budget required (budget will be BBGEF).</a><br />
