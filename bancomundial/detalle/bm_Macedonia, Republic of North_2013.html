The Program Development Objective of the proposed second single tranche PBG II is to improve the efficiency of public expenditures and public financial management, strengthen pension and health systems and improve social inclusion and targeting of social assistance. In addition, the proposed PBG II would provide incremental market access by helping Macedonia in preserving continued market access at reasonable terms and expanding the borrower's name in the financial market over the medium term. It is expected that the PBG II would improve Macedonia's borrowing terms considerably. Board Schedule Comments</a><br />
