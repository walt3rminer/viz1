This empowerment will have positive impacts on poverty within these communities, as well as on the overall inclusion ofthese communities in terms of service delivery and exercise of rights.   In addition, institutional performance by key stakeholders, including civil society organizations and government entities, related to provision of services to refugees will be improved underthe general framework of legal aid services in Jordan.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">6000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P122717" target=_blank>The objective is to improve public sector service delivery for selected priority services, streamline the government structure, and strengthen human resource planning and management across the public sector, in line with the Government's Public Sector Development Program.  The Government's Public Sector Development Program constitutes one of the strategic pillars of the implementation plan for the "National Agenda" which is the overall development strategy for the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.  The goal of the program is to develop the public sector and improve accountability and performance orientation. The program focuses on a significant number of priority areas which include (inter alia) the restructuring of selected government sectors to make them more efficient and effective, the improvement and simplification of procedures throughout the public sector, the improvement of the Government's Human Resources Management system, and the strengthening of the service delivery culture throughout the public service. The proposed World Bank project will be a technical assistance loan to assist the Government to improve public sector efficiency and strengthen capacity to implement reforms. The proposed project will directly support the implementation of Government's Public Sector Development Program, and will selectively support areas within the wider Government's program where the Bank can provide added value. The project is expected to support the implementation in service delivery improvement and e-governance, streamlining government structure and human resource management. The design of the project will include the following principles to mitigate challenges and risks: (i) analytical work to strengthen reform; (ii) change management processes and communication to systematically involve all relevant stakeholders to improve coherence, build consensus, support and ownership of reforms; (iii) incremental approach to validate and test methodologies and approaches before scaling up; and (iv) capacity building.</a><br />
