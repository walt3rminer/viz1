The PRSO will support the next phase of policy and institutional reform required to maintain growth and accelerate poverty reduction by facilitating trade and diversifying exports, guaranteeing land tenure and increasing access to land for the rural poor, and making the budget a credible management tool and reducing fiduciary risk to public funds. The PRGO program would support outcomes that are driven by policy measures and expenditure policy, both of which are supported by the development partner community as necessary for underpinning medium term growth and accelerating poverty reduction. PRGO-1 features 10 prior actions across private sector development, public financial management, and land and natural resources management.</a><br />

[PDO (i) relates to Cambodia and PDO(ii) relates to Lao PDR. Since it is a regional project, the PDOs reflect the objectives of the beneficiary countries in addition to the regional dimension of the project.]</a><br />
