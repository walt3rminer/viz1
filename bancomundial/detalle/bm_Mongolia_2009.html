The proposed DPC is a single-tranche operation of US$40 million. While it is acknowledged that, because of the magnitude of the shock, the adjustment effort will take place over the next several years, the proposed instrument is a one-off single tranche operation, because of the many uncertainties and risks and the absence of a detailed medium-term policy framework .
