<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">200000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P101335" target=_blank>The proposed DPL is the first in a series of possibly three or four loans supporting the GoP#s reform plan to improve the functioning of Peru#s public sector institutions and business environment.  The loan focuses on two broad areas of policy reform:  # Efficiency and Quality of Fiscal Management # Competitiveness In each of these areas, the GoP has committed to a detailed series of important policy measures as part of an integrated strategy to progressively reform fiscal administration, public spending and the business climate in ways that will lead to specific results that have a broad impact on growth and will be difficult to reverse. In the short term, the DPL will have the twin benefits of: # Strengthening the GoP#s fiscal position with timely budget financing at reasonable terms; and  # Supporting the GoP#s public sector and competitiveness reform agenda. In the medium and long term, reforms supported by the proposed loan series will solidify Peru#s overall fiscal framework, improve the efficiency and quality of public sector spending, and reduce bottlenecks to faster economic growth.  This will in turn result in budgetary savings that can be directed toward priority poverty programs; more and higher quality public services for the citizenry; and more sustainable and broad-based growth.</a><br />

The Majes project was built for irrigation and electricity generation purposes, and uses a 100 kilometer long system of tunnels and canals that have a capacity of 34 m3/s. The project is located in the south of Peru, approximately 180 km from the city of Arequipa. PCF will purchase emission reductions generated by Tarucani  Hydro project.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">25000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P078894" target=_blank>The main objective of the Project is to consolidate a decentralized and sustainable quality real property rights system that facilitates access for the Peruvian population.  This system will enhance the welfare of real property owners and facilitate access to economic opportunities.Even though the Project cannot eliminate all forms/causes of informal tenure, it will reduce the negative impacts of informality and discourage further informality by consolidating the legal security of property rights, completing conversion of informal tenure, and building capacity to address its causes through strategic partnerships of various levels of Government and key stakeholders in the private sector and civil society.  The proposed system will also provide support to the ongoing decentralization program of GoP through the institutional strengthening of Participating Municipalities.</a><br />
