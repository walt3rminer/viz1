The target population is the population of Zambians living in all the 72 malarious districts of the country.  However the priority groups among this target population will be children under the age of five years, pregnant women and all those infected with malaria.   The specific objectives of the project are to: (i) increase the percentage of children under 5 years of age who sleep under a treated bed net from 30% to 40% by 2008; (ii) increase the percentage of pregnant women who receive a complete course of intermittent presumptive treatment for malaria from 45% to 55% by 2008; (iii) increase the percentage of people in IRS-eligible districts areas who sleep in appropriately sprayed structures from 40% to 60% by 2008.   These objectives are derived from the overall objectives of the National Malaria Program, to which the project contributes. To increase coverage of interventions for malaria prevention and treatment and other key maternal and child health interventions.</a><br />
