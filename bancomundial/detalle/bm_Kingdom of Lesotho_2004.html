This objective will be accomplished through an APL in two phases.  In the first phase, this objective will be reached by: (a) supporting the implementation of the 1999 Water Resource Management Strategy and its related institutional sector reforms; (b) providing for capacity building to ensure sector policy formulation is coordinated with proposed sector legal and regulatory utility reforms; (c) providing for new management mechanisms that promote commercial incentives in the main sector utility - WASA; and (d) financing needed infrastructure for augmenting urban water supply in Maseru with a particular emphasis on high growth peri-urban and industrial areas. A key outcome of this phase includes an improved institutional framework that will support the implementation of reforms as outlined in the 1999 Policy, with the clarification of the roles of the main institutions in the sector as to service provision, regulation and policy making.  Utility performance will improve to provide better services through a Performance Agreement (PFA) with specific audited and publicly available indicators as well as support to system expansion.  These reforms will set the stage for Phase II of the APL. This phase will be focused on augmenting the bulk supply for the Lowlands that will directly address current severe water scarcity. Phase II is timed to take advantage of the current detailed studies supported by GOL and the EU that will determine the optimized long term solution. The successful implementation of the project will create the sector-wide policy and regulatory framework needed to secure adequate, reliable and affordable water supply and sanitation services, improve governance and autonomy for the provider of these services, and to provide for good water resources management practices to empower the GOL to make choices that will result in adequate supplies over the long term.</a><br />
