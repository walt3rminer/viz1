The program's scope will focus on improving Yemen's national procurement practices by enforcing the use of the new standard bidding documents (SBDs) and the obligation that all public sector entities have to advertise bidding opportunities and bid evaluation results with the aim to achieve i)better management of public recourses ii) greater government accountability iii) enhanced private sector participation in bidding opportunities, and iv) promote civil society to play its monitoring role (“social auditing”) in the bidding processes and during contract execution. The program would enable Yemen to improve its national procurement practice, by creating awareness and developing the capacity of the Government officials in the targeted implementing agencies , the service providers, and civil society at centralized and decentralized levels. Active participation of civil society is key to ensuring demand for food governance and social accountability of government expenditures. Yemen's current situation of volatility and instability, the extremely high levels of malnutrition, scarce water resources, unfulfilled basic needs and civil society's high expectations for improvement makes the proposed intervention of the utmost urgency.</a><br />
