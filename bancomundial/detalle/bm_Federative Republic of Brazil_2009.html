<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P086341" target=_blank>To increase the conservation and restoration of biodiversity in the state's grassland ecosystem through mainstreaming biodiversity conservation within the forestry, agriculture and livestock productive landscapes.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">195450000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P103770" target=_blank>The proposed loan will support significant and sustainable reforms in key areas of public administration. These reforms would expand fiscal space for public investments. They will also allow the State to use more effectively its own resources and those transferred by the Federal Government to undertake a program of targeted capital investments and improve its management capability. Such improvements are a necessary condition for eventually meeting the high order objectives of reducing poverty levels and achieving levels of economic growth comparable to those of other states in the region. In addition, the proposed loan will help the State to comply with the Federal Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL), a purpose shared by Brazil#s Federal Authorities.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">44000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P104995" target=_blank>The objective of the project is to enhance the management capacity of the Santos Municipal Government for local economic development and to improve public services in the Northwest Zone of the Municipality of Santos.    The key indicators of the project include: (i) initiation of a plan to address constraints to local economic development by 2011; (ii) provision of urban services to households in slum areas; and (iii) rehabilitation and improvement of the existing macro-drainage system in the Northwest Zone with sufficient capacity to handle 25-year flood levels.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">24300000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P099469" target=_blank>The Project Development Objective is to contribute to strengthening environmental capacity in key Brazilian institutions.  This would be accomplished by enhancing the environmental management capacity of institutions at the Federal, State, Federal District and Municipal levels and by demonstrating the effectiveness of targeted subprojects focused on defined priorities.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">39500000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P101508" target=_blank>The objective of the Project is to increase the adoption of integrated and sustainable farming systems approaches in specific areasof the Borrower's territory and help re-establish an agricultural productive environment in areas of the Serrana Region affected bythe January 2011 natural disaster, thus contributing to the higher-order objective of increasing small-scale farming productivity and competitiveness in those areas.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">30000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P110617" target=_blank>The proposed project would increase social and economic opportunities for the rural poor in Bahia by improving their access to basic socioeconomic infrastructure, thus contributing to the Borrower?s objective of increasing the HDI. While building on the CDD approach proven successful under the first phase of Produzir, the proposed second phase would improve on this experience by:  (a) integrating with and/or complementing activities of other Bank loans for the State (under the Bahia State Program), particularly the PGRH and Viver Melhor Urbano II;  (b) strengthening the cross-sectoral integration and providing significantly more emphasis on education, health, culture, natural resources management and environmental sustainability; and (c) scaling up the impact on poverty by using the skills, social capital and experience of the Municipal Councils and community associations to improve the relevance, efficiency, sustainability, targeting and outcomes of non-project State and Federal investments in rural Bahia.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">166650000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P106663" target=_blank>The project development objective is to improve the efficiency of the paved municipal road network.  Efficiency will be improved as a result of improvements to the institutional framework used by the Borrower in four key areas to deliver adequate transport conditions to users (planning, environmental licensing, participation of private sector, and execution), combined with improvements in the condition of the paved municipal road network.</a><br />

The SEM DPL I also treats climate change concerns at both the inter-sectoral level and within the targeted sectors (natural resources, water, sanitation, and energy).</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">71500000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P102818" target=_blank>The Project Development Objective is to support the adoption of environmentally friendly land use practices on 3,400 hectares in two key Atlantic Forest watersheds in Espirito Santo, thereby contributing to improved biodiversity conservation. Key indicators include:   # Increase in area (3,400 has) under sustainable land use practices (SLMs);  Which will be accomplished in part through the:  # Establishment and implementation of institutional arrangements for payment mechanisms for watershed conservation; and  # Supporting the adoption of Sustainable Land Management (SLM) practices through the implementation of Payment for Environmental Services mechanisms and the participation and capacity building of local actors. The development objectives of this additional financing will be to meet the original objectives of Project Brazil - P006522 - Espirito Santo Water & Coastal Pollution: 1. Improve the efficiency of the water supply and sewerage systems of the State Water Company of Espirito Santo (CESAN) by supporting its efforts to operate on a commercial basis with financial self-sufficiency. 2. Increase the coverage level of CESAN's water supply and basic sanitation services in the urban areas of Grande Vitoria, Guarapari, Castelo, Iuna, Sao Gabriel de Palha, Nova Venecia, Concepcao da Barra, and other towns located in the Santa Maria and Jucu river basins. 3. Provide appropriate water and sanitation infrastructure in low-income urban areas of Grande Vitoria and Guarapari. In addition, additional financing will allow the project to meet its original objective of strengthening SEAMAs and IEMAs environmental management capacity.</a><br />
