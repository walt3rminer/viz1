The Project Development Objective  is to align, for the first time, the expertise and resources of the global coral reef community around key research questions related to the resilience and vulnerability of coral reef ecosystems, to integrate the results, and to  disseminate them in formats readily accessible to managers and decision-makers. A related objective is to build much-needed capacity for science-based management of coral reefs in developing countries, where the majority of reefs are found.These objectives will be achieved through targeted investigations involving networks of scientists, in consultation with managers, and the dissemination of knowledge within and across regions to decisionmakers.</a><br />
