The Program is being implemented in four stages (APL1-4).  The start up of each Program stage is based on the measured progress of implementation of components of each stage and the associated policy and institutional reforms, especially the readiness of the programs and contract awards for planned physical investments.  The main focus of the program is on: (a) construction and rehabilitation of key links to remove constraints to growth and access and expedite exploitation of the vast natural resources, integrate the country, provide access to marginal and drought prone areas and reduce transportation cost; (b) strengthening the road management and financing reform program to ensure sustainability; (c) developing the capacity and increasing the participation of domestic consultants and contractors in the implementation of road contracts; and (d) developing a network based approach and addressing social, environmental and development issues in a comprehensive manner.  Project development objective:  The objectives of the RSDP 2 Stage 2 (the Project) is to support the increase in road transport infrastructure and improve its reliability, strengthen the capacity for road construction, management and maintenance, and create conditions conducive to private sector participation in the road transport sector.

The Project has four components: Component 1 on the Basic Services Sub-Program to maintain the delivery of basic services provided by regional and local governments, comprising: (a) financing of sub-national delivery of basic services; and (b) monitoring of (i) the level and timeliness of funding allocations for basic services to ensure additionality targets are met, (ii) the fair application of distributional rules, and (iii) actual spending levels on basic services and its distribution. Component 2 on the Health MDG Performance Facility Sub-Program to provide predictable financing for those critical inputs for primary health service delivery subprogram that cannot be efficiently financed at Woreda level through the block-grant supported under Component 1. It will support three types of activities: (i) procurement and distribution of critical health Commodities; (ii) Capacity building; and (iii) Strengthening of procurement and logistics. Component 3 on Government Systems on Financial Transparency and Accountability Sub-Program which will support activities at the Regional/City Administrations, Woreda and sub-Woreda levels to significantly enhance transparency around public budget procedures (budget preparation, expenditure and audits); and, foster broad engagement, strengthened voice and client power of citizen representative groups and citizens more broadly on public budget processes and public service delivery. Component 4 on Social Accountability, will through a World Bank administered Multi-donor Trust Fund, support capacity-building for, and piloting of, selected large-scale pilot initiatives aimed at stregtheningcitizen voice and enhancing accountability of public sector service providers to citizens. These pilot initiatives will be implemented by CSOs. The component will also work to build demand-side pressure for accountability to public budgeting process and will build capacity of citizens to engage in the public budget process.</a><br />
