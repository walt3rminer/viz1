<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">238000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P082977" target=_blank>The original Project Development Objective for the PPAF-II remains unchanged: to reduce the incidence of poverty in the country through provision of resources and services to the poor, especially women. The additional financing for social mobilization enables key PPAF partner Organizations (POs) to expand their social mobilization programs to cover an additional one million poor rural households in 25 of the poorest districts of the country and provide a foundation for the expansion of Pakistan's poverty reduction agenda through PPAF and the PPAF-III project. PPAF's POs will mobilize approximately 50,000 Community Organizations (COs), which federate at Union Council levels, to form Local Support Organizations (LSO), and higher level in order to access public and private development resources and services and to link communities more effectively to local government and the private sector. A leadership cadre of 250,000 women and men will be trained to manage the COs and federations and to manage the linkages with outside organizations for long term sustainability. Restructuring of the additional financing in July 2009 introduced additional outcomes on community infrastructure and market linkages including, including the provision of 1,200 new infrastructure schemes and skills training for at least 1,000 individuals in the four districts of the Sindh Coastal Area development (SCAD) program.</a><br />

The principal indicators for judging achievement of development objectives are: 1. HIV prevalence among vulnerable populations as measured by sero-prevalence surveillance 2. Sexually transmitted infection (STI i.e., syphilis) prevalence among vulnerable populations,as measured by sero-prevalence survei llance 3. HIV prevalence among women coming for antenatal care (ANC) as measured by periodic surveys in selected health facilities 4. Condom use during last sex act among vulnerable populations as measured by behavioral surveillance 5. Use of clean needles during last week by injecting drug users (IDUs) as measured by behavioral surveillance 6. Percent of blood transfusions in public sector screened for HIV in labs meeting quality assurance (QA) standards as judged by thi rd party assessment of blood banks in public sector. 7. Percent of general population expressing a positive attitude towards AIDS patient as measured by a household survey to assess pub lic knowledge & attitudes 8. Among general adult population admitting to sex with non-regular partner, proportion using a condom, as measured by household sur vey to assess public knowledge & attitudes.</a><br />
