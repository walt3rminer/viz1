To address these issues, PROLOCAL emphasizes the importance of (i) social capital development based on the organization, (ii) human capital formation based on education and services, and (iii) access to productive assets based on sustainable use of natural resources, value-added chains, and off-farm economic opportunities linked to peri-urban activity. PROLOCAL approach of using communities and their territorial or second-tier organizations to implement the project follows the arrangements being carried out by the Bank-financed Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian Development Project (PRODEPINE). While PRODEPINE depends on ethnic affinity groups to channel resources, PROLOCAL works with non-indigenous peasant communities, and its intervention focuses on different geographical areas. Benchmark indicators of project performance include: --60,000 households take active role in elaborating own local development plans; --150 local governments collaborate with beneficiaries in generating development plans at the Parroquia and Cant√≥n levels; --80% of expected counterpart contributions are made available by local organizations; --30% of individuals participating in community development planning process are women; --80% of beneficiaries are poor; --Beneficiary households improve access to productive assets; --Beneficiary households improve access to quality rural development services; --Income level of beneficiaries of productive projects improves by 15%; --Under-employment among beneficiaries households decreases by 20%.</a><br />
