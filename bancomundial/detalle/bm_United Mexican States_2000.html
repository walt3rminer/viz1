The overarching development objective is to im prove transport efficiency on the road network. Complementary objectives  include: (i) improving SCT's rehabil itation and maintenance planning performance; and (ii) enhancing  private-sector participation in road maintenance.</a><br />

Developement Objectives have not and will not change under the proposed restructuring but will be implemented under an innovative strategy of exante risk management and the use of insurance instruments to finance natural disaster losses.</a><br />
