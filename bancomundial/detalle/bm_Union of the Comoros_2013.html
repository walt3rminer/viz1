Specifically, the project will contribute towards improving public financial management and public administration.  The operation will also be instrumental in helping the authorities maintain a good track record under the ECF-supported IMF program, and in fulfilling key #triggers# towards reaching completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative.  It will also help implement major policy reforms targeted by the complementary DPO.  Both operations have been conceived, along with the ISN, as an integrated package.  While the DPO provides visibility and high-level government focus to the reform program in the areas of public administration and public financial management, the proposed TA project will support on-the-ground implementation through technical assistance, learning and equipment.</a><br />
