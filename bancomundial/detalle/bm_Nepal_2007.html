The Carbon Offset project complements the ongoing World Bank Power Development Project by providing additional support for the achievement of its development objectives, in particular the objective of improving access of rural areas to electricity services. The overall development objectives of the Power Development Project are: (a) develop Nepal's hydropower potential in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner so as to help meet electricity demand, (b) improve access of rural areas to electricity services, and (c) promote private participation in the power sector as a way to improve sector efficiency and to mobilize financing for the sector's investment requirements.</a><br />

These objectives will be achieved in three ways: (i) prevention; (ii) preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and containment.  If these goals are achieved, the proposed Project will reduce the burden of disease, the consequent economic losses, the risk of human infection and the loss of productivity attributable to human infections in Nepal and limit the spread to other countries as well.</a><br />
