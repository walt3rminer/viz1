This would entail leveraging the potential of Senegalese waterways to move product using a locally produced biofuel outboard motor to power traditional vessels. Dovetailing with the motor, a simple fuel plant would  be introduced to process indigenous oil seeds into cheaper, reliable, and ecofriendly fuel for the motor.</a><br />
