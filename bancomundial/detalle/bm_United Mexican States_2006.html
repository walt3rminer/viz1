To assist Mexico in developing initial experience in commercially-based grid-connected renewable energy applications by supporting construction of an approximately 101 MW IPP wind fram, while building institutional capacity to value, acquire, and manage such resources on a replicable basis.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P089171" target=_blank>The project development objective is to enhance the provision of environmental services of national and global significance and secure their long-term sustainability. This would be done by strengthening and expanding the national PSAH and CABSA programs and supporting the establishment of local payments for environmental services (PES) mechanisms in selected pilot areas.    The objective will be achieved through the following key outcomes and outputs: (i) strengthening the capacity of CONAFOR, community associations, and NGOs to increase flexibility and improve efficiency of existing service provision to support long-term development of the PSAH program in Mexico; (ii) establishing and securing sustainable long-term financing mechanisms; (iii) establishing legal, institutional, and financial arrangements to pilot market-based mechanisms for payment for environmental services; (iv) documenting links between land use changes and water services improvements and biodiversity conservation; and (v) defining good practices to replicate, scale up, and sustain market-based PES programs.</a><br />

Build on past competitiveness efforts, strengthen new and existing programs, and promote a holistic, cross-governmental approach to improving productivity in order to accelerate growth and increase export and employment levels; and  b. Contribute to the formulation of a medium-to-long term competitiveness policy agenda and help lay a solid foundation of competitiveness programs in advance of the next administration, which takes office in December 2006.  Specifically, the DPL aims to improve the competitiveness of Mexico's economy through the following channels:  1) Promote technological innovation; 2) Improve training and education levels of the workforce; 3) Reduce the cost of doing business; 4) Facilitate new business entry; 5) Strengthen economic competition; 6) Streamline trade procedures and lower trade costs; 7) Facilitate customs clearance; 8) Improve the quality of port services; 9) Implement transparency measures and regulatory instruments for the energy sector.</a><br />
