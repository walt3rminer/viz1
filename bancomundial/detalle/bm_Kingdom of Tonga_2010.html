(the electric utility), and more than ten development partners, represents the first step.   The project will contribute to filling the projected FY11 budget gap and provide resources that will allow the Government of Tonga to take the initial steps, particularly regarding the institutional arrangements, necessary to begin implementation of the Tonga Energy Roadmap.  The project will be a single tranche operation and will be the first in a programmatic series of two operations.  Board Schedule Comments</a><br />
