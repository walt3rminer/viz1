<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">55000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P084957" target=_blank>The proposed project development objective would be to promote market-oriented agricultural diversification with the aim of increasing and stabilizing the incomes of poor smallholders in the central highland and coastal provinces. This would contribute to the growth of the rural economy and the reduction of rural poverty in the country's central region. The expected specific outcomes of the proposed project would be that: (i) farmers adopt new crops and new and environmentally sound production and post harvest techniques; (ii) farmers adopt new livestock production and animal health techniques; (iii) farmers increase productive on-farm investments; (iv) farmers have increased access to information on agricultural markets, including prices; and, (v) food safety and quality standards are promoted for agricultural produce. The proposed project would draw on lessons learned during the implementation of the Agricultural Diversification Project (P004844), which focused on providing smallholder access to key factors of production: land (issuing land use rights); capital (short, medium and long-term credit provision); and technology (smallholder rubber sector development and livestock and crop extension services). Under ADP, institutional arrangements and mechanisms have proven to be appropriate, with some adjustments, for implementing each project component. The implementation arrangements for the proposed project would be largely based on those under ADP. It is envisaged that the proposed project would have the following components: (i)  crop production systems improvement (support to crop production and post-harvest activities, including continued support for smallholder rubber development, through the provision of technical services and credit); (ii)  livestock production (continued development of the livestock sector, including livestock extension and animal health services and the provision of credit); (iii)  market development services (support to market information systems and the strengthening of standards for food safety and quality of agricultural produce); (iv)  land allocation (continued support to land use planning and the issuance of land use rights certificates to households, with particular attention to ethnic minority groups and women); and, (v) institutional strengthening (project management, support to the enhanced participation of ethnic minorities and women, and capacity building in implementing agencies).</a><br />

The project will have a positive impact on the investment climateby building predictable and enforceable tax administration processes and procedures. The sustainability ofrevenue collection will also be supported through implementation of this project.  The PDOs therefore are complementary to two higher level objectives of thecountry's four reform pillars, namely business led development, and strengthened governance systems.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">175000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P101724" target=_blank>The objective of the operation is to support the implementation of Vietnam#s poverty reduction strategy as elaborated chiefly in the Government#s Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006-2010, as well as other breakthrough documents and policy papers of the Government. It reflects the engagement and support of the international community in addressing the challenges currently faced by Vietnam. The proposed credit further deepens the reforms supported by a previous series of policy lending operations, PRSCs 1 to 5.  The measures it endorses cover the following areas: (i) promoting growth and completing the transition to a market economy, through actions to foster international integration, strengthen the governance and deepen the equitization of SOEs, accelerate banking reform and improve the investment climate; (ii) reducing poverty and ensuring social inclusion through actions to improve the financing of healthcare, strengthen policies to fight HIV/AIDS, enhance the quality of education, and redress gender disparities; (iii) ensuring the sustainability of long-term growth through measures to protect the environment and strengthen the management of natural resources; and (iv) building institutions of modern governance, with actions to enhance the transparency and management of public finances, broaden the supervisory role of the National Assembly, improve the delivery of public services, and fight corruption.</a><br />
