Specifically, it aims:  (1) to create and test a set of innovative, flexible, and replicable mechanisms to strengthen beneficiary involvement, leverage experience and lessons learned, and mainstream best practices at (and beyond) the national level;  (2) to strengthen the involvement of informal recyclers, not only as beneficiaries, but also as active agents in the design and implementation of sub-projects and the providing of training, technical support, and other services; and  (3) to develop a sustainable strategy for the inclusion of informal recyclers at both the local and national levels, so as to allow for thecontinuation of funded activities beyond the proposed initial JSDF pilot phase.This JSDF is a way of supporting intensive social inclusion that would otherwise not be a part of solid waste infrastructure investments. By showcasing demonstrated success and sustainability in these pilots, it is hoped that JSDF funding will help leverage the institutionalization of such an approach in the sector in Brazil.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">461000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P119215" target=_blank>i) Help the Government of Minas Gerais to improve the efficiency of public resource use (getting more out of each real spent) and the effectiveness of public resource allocation. Success in meeting this objective on the efficiency side will be measured by some basic fiscal measures (share of personnel expenditure in total expenditure of the Executive part of the Government) as well as the existence, measurement and tracking of cost information in the health, education and transport sectors. Success in meeting the objective on the allocation side would be measured by investment expenditure as a share of total expenditure and expenditure on the strategic projects as a share of total expenditure. (Further detail and benchmarks for these indicators can be found in Annex 3 in the Technical Annexes.)    ii) Support the adoption of innovations in public management of the State.  Success would be measured by the extent of implementation of the Results Agreements in key sectors (see Technical Annex 1), the number of public private partnerships (PPPs) contracted by the State, the percentage of hospitals of the hospitals program (PROHOSP) being assessed for accreditation by the accreditation entity (ONA), and the percentage of state paved roads network under results âbased maintenance and rehabilitation contracts.   iii) Support the Government of Minas Gerais in strengthening the system of monitoring and evaluation of results. Strengthened monitoring and evaluation is not only critical for the project, but is essential for the entire results-based management system established by the state. Success would be measured by Satisfaction of the Vice Governorâs office and Secretaries with available M&E information and strengthening of results/causal chains underlying the Governmentâs program.</a><br />
