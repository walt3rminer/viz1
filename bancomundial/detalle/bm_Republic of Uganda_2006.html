It builds on the preceding four PRSCs, which were approved by the World Bank's Executive Board in May 2001 (US$ 150 million), July 2002 (US$ 150 million), September 2003 (US$ 150 million), and September 2004 ($150 million) respectively. As spelled out in the Bank Group's country assistance strategy for Uganda, the series of PRSCs is the Bank's principal instrument to assist the Government in implementing its PEAP/PRSP.</a><br />
