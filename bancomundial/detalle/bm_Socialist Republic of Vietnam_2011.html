The CPS defined the PRSC as one of the modalities to support the implementation of SEDP.  The Program Document for PRSC 6 charts thesecond cycle of PRSC operations (PRSCs 6-10).  The CPS Progress Report was discussed by the Board in December 2009, and the CPS for2012-16 is scheduled to be discussed by the Board concurrently with its consideration of the proposed operation.  The proposed operation is consistent with the new SEDP 2011-15, expected to be approved in November 2011, and hence with the new CPS.</a><br />

This is in line with and supports the implementation of Vietnam's plans for the medium to long-term control of avian and human influenza as outlined in its National Strategy, and is fully consistent with the approach envisaged under GPAI.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">350000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P120946" target=_blank>Though Vietnam's economy has grown rapidly, the bulk of this growth has come through factor accumulation, with modest contribution from productivity growth. The country therefore cannot achieve its objective of growing at 7 to 8 percent, as indicated in its Socio-economic Development Strategy (SEDS) 2011-2020, without raising the productivity of investment, especially public investment. The reforms supported by PIR 2 attempt to improve the effectiveness of public investment through better project selection, implementation, financial management and oversight.In doing so, PIR 2 supports one of the emerging priorities of the SEDS 2011-2020, namely to raise productivity of investment.  The operation also supports modern governance, which is one of the four main pillars of Vietnam's Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006-2010.  The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) is aligned to the SEDP.  Better planning processes, more transparent procurement and stronger public financial management, all areas covered by the proposed program, fall under the modern governance pillar of SEDP.Through its focus on the environmental screening and the environmental management of projects, the proposed program is also expected to contribute to the natural resources pillar of SEDP. Its attention to fair compensation and livelihood support in the event of land acquisition should also contribute to the social inclusion pillar.</a><br />
