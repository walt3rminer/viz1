This process will ultimately lead to the production of the State of the Cities Report for Nigeria, which will investigate the potential and real contributions of large urban centres to the economy of the country. Ultimately, the report will provide decision makers with a useful instrument for making strategic choices on expenditures, investments and strategic frameworks. Increased awareness of the state of Nigerian cities will be generated, and municipal capacity in utilizing various planning tools and procedures will further be enhanced to better cope with urbanization challenges and improved management. 7b.2.Specific Objectives a) To prepare and adopt a strategy for Nigerian Cities Network and build consensus among stakeholders. b) To assess and analyze the cities# performance in terms of Livelihood, Environmental Sustainability and Service Delivery, Spatial Form and Infrastructure, Financial Resources as well as Governance c) To develop and adopt innovative tools for rapid assessments, including utilization of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing d) To analyze strategic challenges facing Nigerian cities, particularly in the context of urbanization and globalization and disseminate the international best practices of large city governments in addressing economic growth and urban poverty adapted to the Nigerian context e) To advance strategies for enhancing the contribution of cities towards sustainable development, economic growth and poverty reduction in the country. f) To promote partnerships and linkages between the national, state and local governments and the private sectors to support improved pro-poor governance of large cities in Nigeria. g) To disseminate best practise of Nigerian cities.</a><br />
