Th e PDO will be achieved through a school-based, community-driven program targeting 6,000 school-enrolled and out-of-school youth to s upport acquisition of socioemotional skills that are linked not just to success in school, but are also highly valued in the labor m arket. The project will address the largely unmet need for socioemotional and entrepreneurship skills stemming from extremely limite d labor market opportunities that lead to high inactivity among youth in these locations and a job profile dominated by traditional herding, unpaid work and self-employment in the informal sector.</a><br />
