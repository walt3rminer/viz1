Phase 3 will therefore consolidate the accomplishments of Phase 1 and 2 of the Community Based Rural Development Program. It will enhance the capacity of rural communities anddecentralized institutions for the implementation of local development plans that promote sustainable land and natural resources management and productive investments at commune level. This will be achieved by (i) pursuing and completing the work on institutionaldevelopment and capacity building initiated in Phase 1 and 2; (ii) implementing the rural land tenure reform law which was promulgated under Phase 2 and enhancing local dispute resolution; and (iii) social, economic and environmental investments at the commune level to reach a sustainable level; while promoting environmental sustainability in the targeted zones. Phase 3 will provide 302 ruralcommunes and the 13 regional communes with capacity building to enable them to take the lead in local development challenges and togovern in a participatory and transparent manner.</a><br />

At the end of the project, the 16 000 beneficiary households are expected to have survived feed shortage using feed supplements and making greater and more innovative use of crops residues in animal feeding, thereby preserving their livestock-based livelihood. The beneficiary households are also expected to come out of the crisis with healthier animals. Overall, project interventions are expected to help maintain herd size,diet diversity and purchasing power of targeted livestock breeders across the country.   The Project will be implemented through the existing Project Coordination Unit of the IDA-financed Agricultural Productivity and Food Security Project, which has adequate technical and fiduciary capacity to implement proposed activities. These activities are organized in four components aimed to: (i) improve access to animal feed concentrates, supplements and health products (52% of total financing); (ii) improve use of bulk livestock feed through the use of innovative crop residues shredders (29%); (iii) provide accurate and timely information on the extent of the crisis and existing mitigation measures (5%); and (iv) ensure effective project coordination, management, monitoring and evaluation and knowledge dissemination (13%).</a><br />
