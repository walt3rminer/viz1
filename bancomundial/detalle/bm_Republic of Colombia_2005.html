In particular, the project will support (i) the incorporation of environmental considerations in the policies of the sectors that result in a high cost of environmental degradation (e.g., health, transport, and water); (ii) the implementation of policy measures for integrated water resource management; (iii) the optimization of urban development policy instruments to improve urban quality of life; and (iv) the strengthening of the planning, monitoring, and oversight of national, regional and local environmental management and policies.  By supporting these objectives, the project is expected to help alleviate the effects of environmental degradation on the most vulnerable segments of the population, particularly children who are typically the most affected by this degradation, through improvements in public health and quality of life.  These improvements will be supported through reductions in air and water pollution, as well as through improved hygiene and urban environmental management.</a><br />
