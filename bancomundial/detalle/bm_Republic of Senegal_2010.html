For the purpose of this project, economic governance means the policy, institutional, and behavioral framework that govern the activities of the private sector while efficiency of commercial justice refers to the speed of decisions of justice and the ease of access to justice for commercial cases. Revised PDO outcome indicators are: • Number of cases pursued by CENTIF doubled from 12 to 24 by 2016;• The average time to enforce a commercial contract is reduced from 780 to 529 days by 2016;• Increase in the number of decisions taken per year at the TRHCD on Commercial Cases.</a><br />

This will contribute to the achievement of the water and sanitation MDGs.  The proposed project will achieve its objective by (i) facilitating access to services through programs for improving and extending water production and distribution systems and urban sanitation networks, constructing social water and sanitation household connections, public standpipes and on-site sanitation facilities, and (ii) consolidating the achievements of the urban water reform, supporting the rural water subsector reform and strengthening capacities to deliver and manage water and sanitation services.</a><br />
