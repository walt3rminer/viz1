The project will finance activities under four components: (i)animal health, (ii) human health, (iii) public awareness and information, and (iv) implementation support, monitoring and evaluation. Even though the activities are organized by sectoral components, the project calls for an integrated national plans that ensure common objectives across sectors for dealing with this issue. Moreover, as knowledge about Avian Flu and influenza preparedness continues to evolve these components are indicative of activities to be financed. I. ANIMAL HEALTH COMPONENT The project will support national prevention and control strategies to cover the needs in the short, medium or long term. It will specifically support the four areas of activities described below: - Enhancing HPAI prevention and preparedness capability for countries at-risk; - Strengthening of Veterinary Services, disease surveillance, diagnostic capacity and applied research for HPAI disease-free and infected countries; - Strengthening HPAI control programs and outbreak containment plans, for countries in pandemic situation and newly infected countries; and - Improving bio-security in poultry production and trade, with the longer term vision of restructuring the poultry industry. II. HUMAN HEALTH COMPONENT Immediate action is needed in a number of areas, but there is also a longer-term agenda given systemic shortcomings with respect to core public health functions. Efforts should be made to ensure that short-term responses are consistent with and contribute to proposed longer-term interventions. The interventions would be grouped into three categories: - Enhancing Public Health Program Planning and Coordination - Strengthening of National Public Health Surveillance Systems - Strengthening Health System Response Capacity III. PUBLIC AWARENESS AND INFORMATION COMPONENT This component will be designed to safeguard human health, in particular for extension staff, animal health workers, poultry producers and their families, by improving public awareness and information. It consists of three sub-components: - Communication preparedness - Communications and information campaigns to improve public awareness. - Pilot Models for Community-based Rapid Communication IV. IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT AND MONITORING AND EVALUATION COMPONENT The project would support the establishment and strengthening of public structures for the coordination and management of the project, including arrangements for coordination of activities, project monitoring and evaluation, financial management and procurement.</a><br />
