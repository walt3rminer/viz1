These measures could include elements of the fiscal reform package passed in early 2005 and also of the social security reforms passed later in the year.  The DPL is being considered as a one-off operation under the Bank's Interim Strategy Note, but could eventually serve as background for a programmatic series of DPLs that may be considered under the framework of a new CAS.

The grant legal agreement was provided to GOP in May 2002 following a two month delay while the Bank completed it's internal dialogue on setting the Standard Disbursement Percentage (SDP) for Panama and the application of SDPs to PHRD grants.  Subsequently, the issue of financing of taxes with GOP funds resulted in a lengthy approval process  on the part of Panama's Ministry of Finance.  It has only been as of mid-November 2002 that Finance has approved the grant agreement for signing and has committed to sign prior to December 15, 2002.  During the delay, the Ministry of Agriculture made substantial advances on the policy and institutional fronts such that conditions for finalizing the design and project documents are good.  An all out effort to finalize preparation and bring the project to the Board will be made during the second helf of FY03.  A December 2002 WB/FAO Investment Center mission to Panama has assisted to establish the conditions locally to finalize the preparation.</a><br />
