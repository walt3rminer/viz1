<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P122208" target=_blank>The objective is to bring together infoDev's experience with ICT-enabled innovation and entrepreneurship, in particular its African network of business incubators, with Nokia's expertise on mobile applications in emerging markets in order to extend mobile applications in Asia. The expected impact is to increase the number of mobile applications entrepreneurs in Asia.  The expected intermediate results are the hosting of events to promote innovation in the mobile sphere, targeting around 1000 participants from 400 or so companies, NGOs, government agencies and other organizations that would participate in the online and offline actvities, and promoting the visibility of the Asian chapters at a global level, for instance through a dedicated webspace and competititions with winners to gain entry to international events, such as infoDev's Global Forum for Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Helsinki (May/June 2011) The main knowledge output of this activity will be inputs to the Mobile Flagship Report (GLO 1 under TF071399) to evaluate lessons learned from this experiment in social networking and to show the development potential of mobile applications.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">37000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P105198" target=_blank>The objective is to support the State Securities Commission (SSC) to enhance its ability to monitor the compliance with its regulations by public companies and market participants, to enforce, enhance transparency and fairness of the market.  The overarching objective of the proposed FMID is to assist the capacity building of the nonbank financial supervisors and the State Capital Investment Corporation, and the upgrading of the financial market infrastructure.  It aims to promote sound corporate governance of public companies by supporting the supervisors to enforce disclosure of information by public companies and market participants while coping with the rapidly expanding and diversifying capital markets.  It aims to support the implementation of Prime Minister's Decision on Securities Market Development and the formulation and implementation of a capital market roadmap. Components COMPONENT 1:    Supervisory Capacity Building and Market Infrastructure  This component would support the capacity building of the SSC and Insurance Dept. of MOF while leaving the Bank Inspection Dept. of SBV for FSMIS project.  As the second subcomponent, it also supports the upgrading of the market infrastructure including the central company registry system, the central securities depository system, a bond tranding system as well as regulatory infrastructure such as e-disclosure system, e-registration system for licensed market professionals. Assistance to be provided will be built around investment operations to finance ICT systems of the SSC and Insurance Dept and include training to build HR capacity to use the new systems most effectively and advice on the institutional reform and strengthening of the two supervisors.  In particular, the component will support the development of standards, methodology and expertise to audit the adequacy of electronic data processing (EDP) capacity of securities market participants and insurance companies. COMPONENT 2:  Capacity building of the State Capital Investment Corporation (SCIC) This component will support the ICT and HR capacity building of the State Capital Investment Corporation (SCIC) which is the state holding company in the equitized enterprises.  It is positioned to promote sound corporate governance of the equitized enterprises to enhance their value while divesting from non-strategic enterprises.  Thus, it contributes to the development of the securities market as a major supplier of shares to the market.  At the same time, it relies on the efficient functioning of the market in achieving its mandate.</a><br />

The CPS defines the PRSC as one of the modalities to support the implementation of SEDP.  The Program Document for PRSC 6 charts the second cycle of PRSC operations (PRSCs 6-10).  The CPS allocates US$ 150 million to each of the PRSCs in this cycle.  In practice, however, the amount for PRSC 6 was increased to US$ 175 million.  PRSC 7 was presented to the Board in June 2008 for the amount of US$150 million.  PRSC 8 was approved in 2009 for US$ 350 million under the Fast Track Facility.  The increased amount was in response to the government#s request to support the fiscal stimulus package to combat adverse effects of the global financial crisis.</a><br />
