To this end, the Project will enable the Borrower to implement the National Strategy for the New Economy and Implementation of the Information Society, and the European Union programs related to the information society for all.  Specifically, in targeted disadvantaged communities, Local Community e-Networks (LCeNs) would evolve into a daily tool for education, business and public communications with the Government, with increasing private management and financial self-sustainability.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">100000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P083959" target=_blank>Preliminary Project Description The project utilizes a multi-sectoral approach designed to offer a menu of tools and interventions.physical, financial, and managerial.to help support diversified economic growth, restructure the economy and create new jobs in the region and prospects outside the mining sector. The lending instrument proposed for the JVR development project is a phased investment or an APL, given the needed prioritization/sequencing of activities and long-term horizon. The project will have three main components as described below. A. Institutional Capacity Building This component will focus on establishing and building the capacity of local institutions to develop and implement an effective regional development plan. Currently, the public authorities lack adequate financial and human resources to formulate effective policies, sequence reforms, and guide the region.s development agenda. B. Business Environment Private sector development is critical to the region.s long term prospects for growth. However, given the unlikely immediate direct investment in the region by outside firms, the development strategy must focus on strengthening aspects of the business environment. This will require a multi-faceted approach to produce a setting that attracts new investment as well as incubates and supports local businesses. This component will support a range of policy reforms and investments including the following: ·   Reducing barriers to business entry and operations.  The recent World Bank Firm Analysis and Competitiveness Survey indicated an number of shortcomings in the business environment: the unpredictability of business legislation; high levels of taxation, lack of hiring and firing flexibility, concern over protection of ownership and contractual rights, the unreliability of the judicial system, and distrust of state institutions, with broad suspicion of corruption and cronyism. Thus, the project will support policy interventions to identify and remove hindrances to business operation and investment though improvements to the legal and regulatory environment and through the reduction of administrative costs to businesses. The goals will be to streamline processes and remove these obstacles where possible, thus making it easier for businesses to invest and flourish in the region. ·   Improving physical access to the region and local infrastructure. Basic infrastructure service is an important element of the investment climate. Improvements in infrastructure will contribute meaningfully to long-term economic growth by (i) facilitating promotion of tourism through improved aesthetics and public services, easing physical access to the region, and ensuring quality utilities, (ii) opening the region.s economy to outside regions to facilitate trade, broadcast public image programs, and facilitate knowledge sharing. Thus, the project will include financial support and technical assistance to upgrade public infrastructure in the region. It will not involve massive rehabilitation efforts, but rather target a few key sectors (such as roads and housing) that would help open up the region, improve livability, and bolster morale through improved public services and transportation by offering immediate identifiable improvements. All activities will specifically tie into and build upon the Bank-financed Secondary Roads Project, which is currently under preparation. ·   Environmental restoration. Due to the exploitation of the hard coal reserves and excessive mining activities, the Jiu Valley natural environment has been severely damaged. Land reclamation and rehabilitation efforts sponsored by the project need be prioritized along expected uses, such as public areas, housing, business, and possibly tourism activities. Given the high cost of clean-up activities, active labor schemes could be targeted for this purpose, also as means to transfer useful skills for later uses (e.g. land, water, and forest management).

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P086810" target=_blank>The Romanian government promotes the establishment of forest shelterbelts near settlements, on crop land and along irrigation systems, as a way to improve microclimates and control droughts, which have become more prevalent over the recent decades. These objectives are among those of Law No. 289 .Forest Shelterbelts. (May 15, 2002), Governmental Resolution No. 547 (May 17, 2003) on the establishment of a national system of shelterbelts, and the draft .National Strategy and Action Programme Concerning Desertification, Land Degradation and Drought Prevention and Control. (2000). To support these objectives, and also mitigate global climate change, the BioCarbon Fund would purchase ERs generated by 2,000 ha of forest shelterbelts (windbreaks) in eight counties (Calarasi, Constanta, Dolj, Galati, Giurgiu, Ialomita, Olt, Teleorman). In order to establish these 2,000 ha, about 67,000 ha of agricultural land must be found, since these shelterbelts, ranging from 10 meters to 30 meters in width, typically cover 3 percent of agricultural land. Shelterbelts protect against wind and soil erosion. In addition, shelterbelts increase moisture retention, enhance biological diversity, and improve microclimatic conditions. Ultimately shelterbelts improve soil productivity and agricultural yields. Shelterbelts are an effective store of carbon as they build dense strips of vegetation, while they do not take land away from production.    Depending on the preferences of local communities on whose land the project would be implemented, measures could also be supported that enhance carbon sequestration through better agricultural techniques such as reduced tillage, while also achieving other environmental benefits. Species planted would include trees, e.g. Robinia pseudoacacia, Gleditschia triachantos, Prunus cerasifera, Prunus avium, Juglans regia, Eleagnus angustifolia, and possibly Quercus sp., and shrubs, e.g. Rosa canina and Crataegus monogyna. Compared to the PCF afforestation project, the cost of establishing shelterbelts is expected to be lower per ha: (1) the land is less degraded than the land afforested under the PCF project; and (2) more carbon would be sequestered per ha, increasing reimbursements to the financier. Financing    Financial resources to plant the shelterbelts would be found from a variety of sources, including, possibly, the national budget through the Ministry of Agriculture, Forests, Waters and Environment.s Land Reclamation Fund, the World Bank.s loan to  the Irrigation Rehabilitation and Reform Project, the Global Environmental Facility (GEF).s grant for the Agricultural Pollution Control Project, and local communities themselves. The proceeds of the sales of ERs to the BioCarbon Fund would then reimburse the financiers on an annual basis proportionally and to their share of the project costs and depending on the level of carbon sequestration realized by the project.    No Bank budget would be involved in the preparation or the supervision of the project. A part of the preparation costs would be borne by the PHRD Grant and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forests, Waters and Environment, while the balance of these costs and the supervision costs would be borne with the BioCarbon Fund. Institutional Arrangements    This project will need a different implementation arrangement than the first PCF Afforestation project to the extent that communities are more involved in this new project, primarily because they will decide whether to establish forest shelter belts on their own land, not state-owned land as in the PCF project. The project may benefit from implementation arrangements piloted by various previous projects, in particular the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project and the Agricultural Pollution Control Project. For instance, the communities and budget resources could finance establishment of the shelterbelts with technical assistance from the National Forest Administration (NFA). The ER purchase agreement could be signed</a><br />
