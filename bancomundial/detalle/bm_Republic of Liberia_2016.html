It will establish tangible improvements in transaction processing, reconciliation, and fiscal and financial reporting procedures; and improve budget management and resource allocation and administrative capacity to gradually develop Liberia's own institutional, organizational, informational, and human resource capacities.  The PFM Reform Strategy objectives against each of the themes are addressed in the project components as designed, where one or more objectives have been combined for efficiency and implementation sake.  The Strategy is anchored on five basic criteria: sequencing of major actions; simplicity and realism; lessons learned in prior reforms; ownership and sustainability; and partnership and collaboration.</a><br />
