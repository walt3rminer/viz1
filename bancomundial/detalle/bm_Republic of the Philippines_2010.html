Fishponds in a vast mangrove forest that once protected the villages from storms have been abandoned. With a DM grant, the Trowel Development Foundation will replant mangroves and set up a value-chain system to fatten and market tie-crabs. This will raise local incomes, and build the capacity of fishing villages to adapt to climate change.</a><br />

The Project Development Objective is to support dynamic and coordinated strategic planning in conflicted-affe cted areas through data and analysis, enhanced operational effectiveness and conflict sensitivity and strengthened institutional cap acity for sustainable peace.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">60000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P078252" target=_blank>The objective of the project would be to support the Government meet its major development goals related to growth, equity and poverty reduction, by completing essential processes in agrarian reform as efficiently as possible. This would reduce the overall cost of prolonged uncertainties and distortions in the agriculture sector which currently hamper investment and hence, performance, competitiveness and responsiveness of the sector to changing global trends. More specifically, the project would aim to: (i) rationalize expenditures in line with agreed DLR priorities, thereby supporting governmentâs broader objective of improving public sector effectiveness; (ii) expedite the efficient provision of support services, including, where appropriate, the devolution of functions to other agencies and LGUs; and (iii) scale-up lessons and positive experiences from past projects supporting agrarian reform.</a><br />

The improvement in passenger load will decrease the number of buses on the EDSA as well as decongest vehicular traffic accordingly, which will result in a decrease of total bus-hours per day. This bus-trip-hours optimization will be made by appropriately pacing bus dispatch at each end using a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology.</a><br />
