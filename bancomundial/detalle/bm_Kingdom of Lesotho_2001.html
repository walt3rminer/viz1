<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">28600000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P070673" target=_blank>The Project will address a key constraint in the implementation of Government of LesothoÂ’s ongoing private sector led development st rategy. Specifically, it will seek to improve business infrastructure such as electricity and telecommunication services, including  provisions for internet connectivity in the future. The present low level of coverage has proven to be a bottleneck to attracting p rivate investment.  This will be achieved by the following: (i) improving the quality, coverage and economic efficiency of utility services (Electricity , Telecommunication) under competitive and regulated conditions; (ii) improving financial and operational performance of utilities w hile reducing and eliminating the need for budgetary support to utilities; and (iii) promoting possibilities for local ownership in  shareholding of privatized utilities.</a><br />
