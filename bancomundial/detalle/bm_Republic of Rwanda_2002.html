The four principal objectives of the Program are: (i) demobilize an estimated 20,000 ex-combatants from the Rwanda Defense Force (RDF) and 25,000 members of Rwandese armed groups, and support their transition to civilian life; (ii) in the spirit of the Arusha Accord, support the reinsertion of ex-FAR; (iii) support the social and economic reintegration of all ex-combatants to be demobilized in stage II and all RDRP stage I ex-combatants who remain socio-economically vulnerable; and (iv) facilitate the reallocation of Government expenditure from defense to social and economic sectors. At the current stage of its implementation, the RDRP is moving in the direction of achieving  its development objectives.</a><br />
