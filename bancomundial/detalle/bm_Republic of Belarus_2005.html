The five-year project could comprise selected activities from among some of the following categories: (a) Forest Enterprise.  Increasing the capacity for wood harvesting and processing in order to better utilize forest resources for employment and income generation benefiting local people and affected communities. (b) Optimizing Provision of Heat.  Improving the heating conditions in houses and linking them to a gas-based heating system, thereby reducing the exposure to radionuclides contained in contaminated firewood.  This might also include reducing exposure by retrofitting existing wood burning boilers and increasing safe utilization of wood resources by converting large institutional boilers that need replacement to wood burning boilers where feasible.</a><br />
