This will be achieved through scaling up the SFD's Local Area Development approach of funding well-targeted interventions identified through participatory planning and implementation mechanisms that help poor communities organize collectively to meet their needs and by funding sub-projects using, to the extent possible, labor intensive methods.The relative weight of the employment creation through labor intensive methods is flexible and will be adapted to local and national economic circumstances to allow for a more permanent safety net that can be scaled up or down.</a><br />
