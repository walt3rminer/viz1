The project's development objectives are to improve access to export markets and finance, and enhance the efficiency and performance of trade clearance processes including customs operations and technical controls, thereby making trade logistics more efficient.  By building on the lessons and achievements of the EDP I, the implementation of the Second Export Development Project (EDP II) is expected to strengthen market institutions for export development, enhance competitiveness of Tunisian exporters, and strengthen public-private interface to administer and promote exports.</a><br />

This objective will be achieved through the operationalization of a planning and implementation system of solid waste management at the national and local levels and through the rehabilitation of a number of environmentally harmful dumpsites. These actions will enable the Tunisian Government to enter the emerging global market of carbon credits through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) introduced under the Kyoto Protocol.</a><br />
