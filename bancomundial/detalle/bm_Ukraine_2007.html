This operation was designed by the Government of Ukraine prior to the parliamentary elections of September 30, 2007. It contains a set of objectives and priorities that display significant continuity with earlier government programs and which are likely to remain focus areas for any incoming administration.   Indeed, Ukraine#s basic economic development vision is shared across the political spectrum and includes the growing integration with Europe and the adoption of its institutional framework for the regulation of markets, a strong emphasis on social services and inclusion, and efforts to boost Ukraine#s competitiveness on international markets.  This development vision is concretized in the program supported by the DPL series in three pillars: (i) improving the investment climate to sustain growth, (ii) creating fiscal space for growth through strengthened public finances and public sector reforms; and (iii) improving service delivery and social inclusion. DPL-II supported the completion of around two thirds of the envisaged measures as well as the achievement (in several areas over-achievement) of the associated medium-term outcome indicators.  Improving the investment climate: The Government of Ukraine plans persist in its efforts to improve the business climate focusing on deregulation, inspections reform and the reform of standardization, as well as further customs reforms. Private investment is to be attracted through a new law on Private Public Partnerships and through the adoption of a Law on Joint Stock Companies consistent with OECD principles of good corporate governance. Financial sector regulation is also planned to be strengthened and efforts to improve the financial sustainability of the energy sector and increase its attractiveness for private investment are to be continued. Creating fiscal space for growth: The authorities plan a series of measures to improve the efficiency of the public sector, including tax reform, improvements in tax administration, a new law on public procurement in accordance with international good practice, further improvements in the management and oversight of state-owned enterprises, improved capital budgeting and simplified inter-government fiscal transfers, as well as maintaining an overall ceiling on the fiscal deficit of no more than 3 percent. Improving service delivery and social inclusion: Planned reforms in this area are centered around the increase in the efficiency of spending in health and education as the key to improved service delivery, in particular by revising norms to allow rationalization of facilities and staff and create room for greater investment. Social insurance contributions are also planned to be unified to reduce compliance costs.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">50000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P099919" target=_blank>The Project will have four inter-related components: (i) Courts; (ii) HR Management; (iii) Enforcement of Judgments; and (iv) Support for Implementation and Partnerships. A. COURT FACILITIES, ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT: Component A seeks to increase productivity of the courts through: (i) rehabilitation and construction of court buildings; (ii) redesign of the court organization and business operations; and (iii) strengthening the capacity of the MOJ, the Court Administration Office (CAO) and the courts to manage budget, assets and information (statistics).  The reforms will also secure better access to justice, more efficient and transparent use of resources, higher level of accountability of judges and court managers and better working conditions for judges and court staff.  Combined with the other project activities, these will reduce opportunities for corruption and contribute to the integrity of the judicial system. B. STRENGTHENED HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND TRAINING: Component B seeks to raise the professionalism, competence, accountability and integrity of judges and court employees.  Lack of motivation, knowledge and skills will be specifically targeted under this component.  Both are associated with: ineffective working procedures; non-transparent performance requirements and evaluation and promotion mechanisms; difficulties in accessing business information; weak internal communication; lack of common values and a sense of direction; poor professional image and resulting sense of isolation from society; and lack of credible threat of punishment for corrupt behavior and underperformance. All these factors will be addressed under this component.  Lack of knowledge and skills is associated with insufficient training that does not effectively address the skill gaps. C. IMPROVED ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGEMENTS: Component C seeks to increase the performance of bailiffs through: improvements in the organization and regulatory framework execution procedures and bailiffs# competence, accountability and integrity.  As with the other components, these activities will contribute to raising the integrity and effectiveness of the judicial system. This component will address: the overall organization and map of bailiffs# offices (this will be carried out together with the reform of the court organization, noted in component A); access to the profession; scope of monopolies and intra-professional competition; supervision and management of bailiffs; monitoring and evaluation of their performance; the systems for bailiffs# accountability; the mechanisms that secure their integrity and discipline; the issues of costs of services and client protection; and scope and access to information.  Component C will also strengthen:  (i) the performance and regulatory framework of bailiffs; (ii) management roles, responsibilities and capacities; (iii) operational and management information systems; and (iv) training capacity. D. SUPPORT FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS: Component D would seek the smooth implementation of the Project#s activities. It would also seek to build partnerships with donors and other agencies to encourage broader access to justice initiatives. Such partnerships would generate collaboration and coordination in strengthening aspects of justice sector performance that need attention over the medium term to bring justice closer to people.</a><br />

The main objective of the Power TransmissionProject is to improve the security, reliability and quality of power supply through the rehabilitation of transmission substationsand the strengthening of the power transmission network. The project will also aim to improve institutional capacity and technicalcapabilities of transmission system operator, UkrEnergo (UE), so that it can assure secure and reliable operation of the highvoltage power grid, and, therefore, facilitate unimpeded operation and opening up of the electricity market.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">40000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P103961" target=_blank>The proposed additional financing to Kyivenergo, in the amount of US$ 40 million, would be used to complete the rehabilitation of the CT-1 Heating Plant in Kyiv and to replace old district heating pipes with modern pre-insulated pipes.  Completion of the CT-1 heating plant will finalize the investments envisaged under the first component of the project; i.e. to improve the heat production capacity by replacing old boilers in the main DH system to alleviate the deficit in heat production capacity and meet the existing and growing demand.  The replacement of old heating pipes and installing new ones would contribute to the completion of the second component of the project; i.e. to rehabilitate the district heating system to address the problem of the deteriorating technical conditions. The additional financing has been dropped because the Borrower (MinFin) and Kyiv City and Kyivenergo did not agree on the onlending terms.</a><br />
