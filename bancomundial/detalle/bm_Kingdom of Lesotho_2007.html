<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">8100000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P088544" target=_blank>The key objective of the project is to facilitate increased private sector investment by improving the business environment and diversifying sources of growth. This goal will be achieved by reducing the costs of doing business; strengthening the linkages and integration of the Lesotho economy with the regional economy, especially with South Africa; strengthening support for technical and business management skills thereby improving productivity at the firm level, and improving access to finance for MSMEs. These measures will also support the poverty reduction strategy dialogue and implementation of agreed upon policy measures.</a><br />
