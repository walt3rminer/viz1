Attention will be given to reflecting lessons learned from other similar projects, replicating successful interventio ns, and ensuring continued technical support during project implementation – so this portfolio becomes a series of case studies for the region.#  #  The Regional Partnership for African Fisheries Policy Reform is also a follow-up phase medium sized project to the GEF/World Bank Strategic Partnership project, which was implemented by the AU between 2009 and 2011, and the last project planned un der the Program Framework Document “Strategic Partnership for Sustainable Fisheries Management in the Large Marine Ecosystems in Afr ica” (P125797). TheProject will be financed through a US$2 million Bank-Executed GEF Trust Fund between 2015 and 2018 for a duration  of 3 years. It will act as a regional knowledge and monitoring hub for a SSA GEF/World Bank portfolio of current and pipelinefisher ies reform projects (“participating projects”) and related partner-supported activities, with the objective of improving the accessi bility to best practices and new knowledge on fisheries management of selected SSA countries. Within this context, it is expected th at the Project will assist African coastal countries to make concrete progress towards achieving the fisheries and poverty reduction  targets set by the 2002 WSSD, the follow-up 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), and the 2014 Policy  Framework and Reform Strategy for Fisheries and Aquaculture in Africa. The Project is designed around three thematic components as follows (see Annex C for further detail):#  Component 1: Coalition building (US$0.75 million)#  Component 2: Knowledge support (US$1 .05 million)#  Component 3: Portfolio support (US$0.20 million)</a><br />
