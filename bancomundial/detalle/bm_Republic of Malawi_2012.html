The program would support the Government’s Shire basin Policy Letter , and would have a duration of 12-15 years.  The first phase project – the Shire River Basin Management Program (Phase-I) Project (SRBMP) – would establish coordinated inter-sectoral development planning and coordination mechanisms, undertake the most urgent water related infrastructure investments, prepare additional infrastructure investments, and develop up-scalable systems and methods to rehabilitate sub-catchments and protect existing natural forests, wetlands and biodiversity.  Future phases would consolidate Basin planning and development mechanisms and institutions, undertake further infrastructure investments, and up-scale catchment rehabilitation for sustainable natural resource management and livelihoods.  The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the SRBMP is to develop a Shire River Basin planning framework and improve land and water management for ecosystem and livelihood benefits in target areas. The project would:(a) strengthen the institutionalcapacities and mechanisms for Shire Basin monitoring, planning, management and decision support systems; (b) invest in water related infrastructure that sustainably improves water resources management and development; (c) reduce erosion in priority catchments andsedimentation and flooding downstream, while enhancing environmental services, agricultural productivity and improving livelihoods;(d) improve flood management in the Lower Shire and provide community level adaptatin and mitigation support; and (e) protect and enhance ecological services in the Basin.</a><br />

This MSP is to be implemented, through a PPP with the Malawi Department of National Park and Wildlife (DNPW) and the Wildlife and Environment Society of Malawi (WESM) (a Malawi non profit foundation).   Using the GEF strategy "catalyzing sustainability of protected area management", it aims to strengthen an ecosystem approach through launching a more participatory development of the 180,000 ha Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve with its adjacent community.  The reserve is important for global biodiversity and local livelihood and is located in a country tourism hotspot near the shore of Lake Malawi.  It belongs to the 2020 vision as expressed in the National Growth and Development Strategy particularly for tourism development.</a><br />

The global environmental objective is to strengthen the natural resource base in agricultural lands through doubling the area under sustainable land management as a basis for securing ecosystem services and sustainable agricultural productivity. The project will (i) strengthen institutional capabilities necessary to further develop, and implement, a harmonized and aligned investment framework leading towards a full-fledged SWAp in the agricultural sector; (ii) increase the land, water and nutrient use efficiency of maize based rainfed cropping systems targeted by the Governmentâs Agricultural Development Programme; and (iii) increase the resilience of the maize supply system to cope with climate induced risks and shocks.</a><br />
