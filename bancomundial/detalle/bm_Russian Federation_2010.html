LUKOIL has signed a contract (letter of intentions) with Regionenergogas in which LUKOIL will supply flare gas at fixed prices and consume it back in the form of energy at prices and volumes specified in the contract. The operational company has agreed to pass this power station for indefinite period free of charge to LUKOIL after the end of the 5th year.</a><br />

The Bratsk Hydropower Plant (BHPP) is the second one in a cascade of hydropower plants on the River of Angara and is a world leader in terms of total electricity generation. The additional electricity will be supplied to the energy system of Irkutskenergo and will substitute coal-fired power generation in the Siberian region. The six turbine wheels to be subjected to replacement were installed in the 1960s and now have very high deterioration rates. The company intends to replace these six turbine wheels by new stainless steel ones which have much less cavitation wear and higher power generation efficiency. As a result of the project, total additional power generation by all six wheels during the years of 2008-2012 is estimated as 2,186.4 GWh, considering gradual replacement of the wheels over a four year implementation period.</a><br />
