<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P105907" target=_blank>The Indigenous Peoples Protected Areas Program and Fund (IPPAs) is a major international initiative to provide financial and technical resources directly to Indigenous communities to build their capacity to plan, establish, manage, capitalize, and sustain Indigenous protected areas. First Nations Development Institute/First Peoples Worldwide are requesting a $10 million grant from the World Bank  that will be matched two to one (2:1) for a total of $30 million to launch the IPPA over the next 5 years. The likely sources of World Bank support are GEF, the Global Environmental Facilities and DGF, the Development Grants Facilities. Both are highly competitive and tight so a combination of $5 million from GEF and $5 million from DGF is more feasible than counting on either source for the total amount. Preparation:  The Bank (ENV) is providing a first preparation grant amounting $50,000 dollars  (25,000 from GEF block A, 25,000 from ENV-BB). The preparation grant will permit the assembling of a qualified Project Management Team, the establishment of a project Advisory Board, detailed planning for the project design and activities, building of institutional partnerships required for implementing the  project, and contacts with other donors that could provide project co-funding.  The August Workshop will bring Indigenous Leaders from across the regions that are either from existing indigenous controlled protected areas and/or from protected areas where they reside but do not have any control.  Specifically the consultative process will drive key design elements regarding the most program effective and cost efficient delivery system for making grants to create IPPA#s.  The following issues will be discussed: a) Overall concept of the project and project components; b) Design of the IPPA Grantmaking Program and Fund, particularly the definition of criteria for Indigenous communities to participate in the program; c) Input from the community linked consultative process will also help us to develop the grant application and review process and the systems for monitoring impact.  For instance, how can we assure non-literate communities a relevant application process?  d) The concept idea of the training modules, topics, size and geographical areas  will be discussed during the workshop and the size of the programs; e) The Design of IPPA#s Financial Mechanisms; f) Lessons and Self-Help Network. GEF Work program submission:  We are aiming to present the full proposal to GEF work program entry in November.  The request will be for $ 5 million dollars from the Global allocation. This is a tight schedule but since the project is a Fund Mechanism it might be easier to get through because many of the sub-projects will be defined further down the line (before disbursements are made to the individual sub-projects).  So, GEF can endorse the funding mechanism. Regional Input: Greatest receptivity has been from Africa which is the region housing the program.  ECA has also expressed interest.  Latin America has stated that they have a large portofolio of GEF projects with biodiversity components.</a><br />
