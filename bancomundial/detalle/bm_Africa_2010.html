The Energy Centre at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) in Ghana is currently implementing a Renewable Energy Education Project (REEP) with funding from the EU's EDULink Programme; KNUST's partners in REEP are the International Institute for Water and Environmental Engineering (2IE) in Burkina Faso and Loughborough University's Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technology (CREST) in the UK.  The ultimate aim of this project is to enable The Energy Center, KNUST and its partner institution in Burkina Faso, 2IE, to become capacity-building nodes for the recently-established ECOWAS Regional Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ERC) to be based in Cape Verde; this will make it more cost-effective for ERC to deliver training programmes targeting key actors across both francophone and Anglophone West Africa.</a><br />

By the end of the project, it is hoped that four African chapters will be functioning successfully on a self-sustaining basis and that a platform will have been created for the formation of additional chapters in other African cities.</a><br />
