This would be achieved by: (a) deepening and broadening the institutional reforms that are already underway in Sindh; (b) improving the irrigation system in a systematic way covering key hydraulic infrastructure, main and branch canals, and distributaries and minors; and (c) enhancing long-term sustainability o f irrigation system through participatory irrigation management and developing institutions for improving operation and maintenance of the system and cost recovery. The improved water management would lead to increased agricultural production, employment and incomes over some about 1.8 million ha or more than 30 percent o f the irrigated area in Sindh, and one of the poorest regions o f the country.</a><br />

The Project would also improve access to socio-economic services for local communities in the project area and build WAPDA’s capacity to prepare future hydropower projects.  This would be achieved by installing a 2,160 MW hydropower plant on the main Indus River, which can be expanded to 4,320 MW in future at very low cost.  The Project is a “high-risk-high reward” operation aimed at providing low cost non-carbon renewable energy.</a><br />

It will demonstrate to policy makers the effectiveness of a crafts-based cluster approach to poverty alleviation and to improve living conditions for weavers and embroiderers (especially women and girls) and their families in targeted communities in Punjab and Sindh. The project aims to assist an estimated 2,600 vulnerable artisan families/households, especially targeting women headed households, at the bottom of the pyramid to help them rebuild their lives, access sustainable livelihoods through establishing their own artisan institutions and consequently achieve arobust economic and social empowerment.  With an average family size of 7 individuals in each household in the project areas, the project is expected to benefit an overall population of about 18,200 individuals. Out of the total number of beneficiaries, 70% of the beneficiaries are expected to be women.</a><br />
