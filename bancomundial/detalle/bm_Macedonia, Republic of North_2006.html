Specifically, the project would:  - Change the current unfavorable investment and incentive conditions and create an enabling environment in Macedonia that fosters the development of sustainable energy utilization (in this context defined as efficient use of energy and use of renewable energy sources) through providing financial, methodological, informational, and institutional support;  - Support a large increase in energy efficiency (EE) investment in Macedonia through development of a self-sustaining, market-based financing mechanism based on a principle of commercial co-financing.The project's goal is focused on the development and implementation of financially profitable EE projects, which can provide sustainable and increasing reductions in GHG emissions without relying on public subsidy; and Increase the availability of financing for renewable energy (RE) investments, enterprises and intermediaries through the establishment of a financial facility with a long-term time horizon, which will provide seed capital for debt co-financing of RE projects.</a><br />
