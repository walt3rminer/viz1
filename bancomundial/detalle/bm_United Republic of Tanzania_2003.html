<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">132000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P074072" target=_blank>The PRSC1 credit/grant will support the implementation of Tanzania.s Poverty Reduction Strategy  by:  (a) Accelerating growth:  After nearly a decade of macro stabilization, structural reform and liberalization, the rate of growth of the Tanzanian economy remains low relative to the requirements for effective poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.   A key target therefore is to raise growth to between 6 and 7 percent in the medium term by promoting higher private investment, reducing the cost of doing business, and enhancing the efficiency of the Tanzanian economy. (b) Broadening the impact of growth:  About half of Tanzania.s output derives from the rural economy and more than 70 percent of its population depends on it for its livelihood.  Most of the GoT reforms to date have had a stronger impact in the urban and service sectors.  Hence the program of PRSCs will support efforts to spread the impact of both reforms and resultant growth to the rural income poor through: (i)Enhancement of the profitability of agriculture broadly and export products of rural origin in particular, (ii)improved product quality, higher productivity, reduced marketing cost and improved access to markets (iii)removal of remaining institutional constraints on rural activities;and (iv)correcting the disincentives  arising from the overall tax regime, specially those resulting from the overbearing/multiplicity of local taxes affecting income earning activities in rural areas. (c) Aligning public investment with PRS goals: In addition to continued efforts at improving the private investment climate, there is now a need to bring the development  budget of the GoT in line with the strategic public investment requirements to meet the PRS targets and support the growth of private sector contribution to the economy and livelihoods. (d) Increasing efficiency of public service delivery:  Building on processes that have been put in place to enhance the strategic allocation and impact of public resources for poverty reduction, increase the efficiency of public resource use through measures to further strengthen accountability mechanisms combined with capacity building at the local and central government level.</a><br />
