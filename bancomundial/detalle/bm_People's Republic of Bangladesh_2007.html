To this end, the project is likely to work on four broad tracks: (i) infrastructure for private sector development; (ii)regulatory environment for private sector activity; (iii) capacity building for PSD related policy formulation in government.</a><br />

In particular, the DSCs have supported GoB efforts to both strengthen the core governance functions and improve the investment climate, consistent with the strong emphasis given to these by the PRSP and also the Bank Group?s recent CAS for FY06-09.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">23600000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P098146" target=_blank>The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve performance of the public procurement system progressively in Bangladesh, focusing largely on the target agencies.  The PDO would be achieved by strengthening the ongoing reform process and moving it further along with the following outputs: (i) enhanced capacity in creating a sustained program to develop skilled procurement professionals, (ii) strengthened management and monitoring of procurement in target agencies, (iii) introduction of e-government procurement in CPTU and the target agencies on a pilot basis, and (iv) creation of greater public awareness of a well functioning public procurement system by engaging civil society, think tanks, beneficiaries, and the private sector.  All these actions are key elements in effective implementation of the procurement law/ regulations.</a><br />

Though the objective is specific to HPAI, the interventions are expected to contribute to the control of other zoonotic diseases and other types of infectious diseases, in terms of building overall response capacity in the country.</a><br />

Three key pillars of IDA's support to the Government's reform program are in the areas of system management, teacher effectiveness, and curriculum and textbooks.</a><br />

The objective of the Additional Financing is to diversify microcredit operations to reach a new underserved segment of the urban poor and providing them with technical skills so that they can utilize the microcredit for productive gain to improve their livelihood.  The additional funds would also continue to build institutional capacity in PKSF, the selected POs and the stakeholders.</a><br />
