This will be achieved by: (i) rebuilding and improving health sector infrastructure damaged or destroyed by the earthquakes; (ii) extending the coverage of essential health and nutrition services through a community-based outreach approach; and (iii) strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Health (MOH) to develop and implement policies and priority programs for the health sector.</a><br />
