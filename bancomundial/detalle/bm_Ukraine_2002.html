In line with this objective, the project is aimed at laying the groundwork for the development and expansion of the private sector in Ukraine by: a. Creating constituencies for reform and demand for res tructuring at the enterprise and oblast levels, and responding to this demand by creating sustainable institu tional capabilities, creating a market for managerial expertise and developing local capabilities to utilize and supply this market;  b. Demonstrating the economic pay-offs resulting from po sitive restructuring by assuring the sufficient supply response to reforms (including increased sales, export s, investments, FDI of pilot enterprises); and c. Providing incentives to oblast administrations to improve the local business environment and reduce administrative costs of doing business b y measurable results in these areas as a precondition for receiving  assistance. This approach is intended to demonstrate the benefits that can be expected from successful enterprise restructur ing, training of managers and consultants, and improvements in the legal and regulatory environment for busin ess activities.</a><br />
