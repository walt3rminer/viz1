<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">100000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P086361" target=_blank>The objective of the operation is to support the implementation of the government's strongly owned reform agenda based on the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) adopted in 2002 and expanded in 2003. It reflects the engagement and support of the international community in addressing the challenges currently faced by Vietnam. The proposed credit further deepens the reforms supported by the previous four PRSCs and the now expired Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  The policy measures it endorses are firmly rooted in the CPRGS and cover the following areas: (i) completing the transition to a market economy, including through actions to further international integration, strengthen the equitization process for SOEs, accelerating banking reform and improving the investment climate; (ii) ensuring social inclusion and sustainable development through actions to improve the financing of healthcare for the poor, quality of education for disadvantaged groups, as well as adoption of tools to promote environmental protection; and (iii) building modern governance, through a move towards a planning process focused on development outcomes, strengthening the transparency and management of public finances, simplifying procedures for obtaining public services, and fighting corruption.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">70000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P079663" target=_blank>The project aims to improve health services in the Mekong region and to enhance access to and coverage of these services, especially for the poor through: (i) strengthening the health financing policy framework and increasing the financial accessibility of health services for the poor and near-poor; (ii) improving the availability and quality of curative care, including responsiveness to changing disease patterns; (iii) increasing the capacity of preventive health activities; and (iv) building the capacity of the health workforce.  The project therefore blends support for demand for health care services among the poor and near poor with outlays that address supply-side opportunities and needs while  building physical and human resource capacity.    Key outcome indicators include:  Percentage of poor and others using and expressing satisfaction with the provision of different levels of health services, including hospital care Percentage of poor and near poor to whom health insurance cards have been issued in project provinces  Improvement of quality of hospital care in the project hospitals</a><br />
