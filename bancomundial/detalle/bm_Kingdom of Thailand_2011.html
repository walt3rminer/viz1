The project development objective is to improve efficiency in mass transit services and municipal facilities in the context of Bangkok Metropolitan Authority's city-wide GHG abatement strategy. Achievement of the PDO will be evidenced by: (i) travel time savings for mass transit users (minutes); (ii) percentage reduction in electricity consumption in BMA-managed facilities; and (iii) total tCO2e avoided based: on (a) modal shift to public transport systems (change in gCO2/passenger km); and (b) deployment of energy savings measures (GW/h). Preliminary project description 1. Bus Rapid Transit. The project will provide financial support to accelerate the implementation of selected priority lines of the BRT Master Plan. The plan considers a total of 14 BRT lines, two of which are being constructed already. Moreover, the proposed program will finance part of incremental costs of shifting toward lower emission bus technologies. The program will also finance BRT infrastructure, integration measures with other low carbon and non-motorized transport options, and marketing activities that promote sustained modal shift. It is expected that when completed, the entire BRT system would be able to service more than half a million passengers per day. 2. Improving City EE. The energy efficiency component of the project will invest in retrofitting 588 buildings managed by BMA including BMA offices, hospitals, apartment blocks, schools and wastewater treatment facilities. 3. Both, BRT and EE, would proceed in parallel to other 3 Mitigation components, all of which would support each other component in an integrated manner. 4. Based on experience on the modal shift for the BTS system, which showed that around 15 percent of passengers shifted away from private cars, total GHG emission reductions from the complete BRT system are expected to be 1.89 million tCO2e per annum whereas the first six BRT lines would lead to 1.18 million tCO2e per annum. 5. Capacity Building. Although, BMA has comprehensive experience in the development and implementation of the well-run BTS system, BMA and its wholly owned private enterprise, Krungthep Tanakhom, have little experience in managing and operating a BRT system. Therefore, capacity building support to ensure efficient operations and maximum level of ridership is critical to the success of the proposed Urban Transformation program. The Implementation Support will focus on all aspects of BRT operation and management including marketing, operations and maintenance of the infrastructure and low emission buses, administrative, procurement and financial management, environment and social safeguard, regulation, institutional arrangements, and integration with other modes of transportation. 6. The total investment required for the BMA project is US$1,267 million. The CTF fund will fund US$70 million. On the other hand the IBRD will offer a loan of US$70 million, the counterpart will contribute with $1,127 million and Carbon Finance will contribute with US$116 million more. 7. Total expected annual CO2 emission reduction for the whole BMA program is expected to be 1.18 million tonnes of CO2 per year, which will accumulate to 11.8 milliion tones of CO2 for the project life over ten years.</a><br />

The key project development objectives are to i) increase renewable energy share of Thailand; ii) increase the technical capacity of EGAT and PEA in renewable energy.</a><br />
