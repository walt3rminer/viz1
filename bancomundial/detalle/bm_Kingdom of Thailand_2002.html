<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">5000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P073383" target=_blank>The project has two components: (1) In-Use Motorcycle Upgrade/Scrappage Scheme:  This component envisages instituting an I&M program with elements of carrots for switching to cleaner vehicles and sticks for operating more polluting ones.  This would involve motorcycle testing, minor repairs and tune-ups, and incentives for polluting vehicles to be scrapped and upgraded through an innovative public-private partnership. (2) Capacity-building for monitoring and enforcement of pollution regulation: This component would strengthen enforcement of motorcycle pollution regulations through training, computerization, information management and analytical support, studies, access to expertise, and environment awareness programs.</a><br />
