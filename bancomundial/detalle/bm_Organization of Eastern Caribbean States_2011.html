The objective of the Project in Grenada is to measurably reduce vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change impacts in Grenada and in the Eastern Caribbean Sub-region.  The objective of the Project in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is to measurably reduce vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change impacts in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and in the Eastern Caribbean Sub-region.  The achievement of the Program Development Objectives of the Regional Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Program (RDVRP) would be measured using the following key indicators:  (a) Reduced risk of OECS population to failure of public buildings and infrastructure due to natural hazards or climate change impacts; and  (b) Increased capacity of OECS Governments to identify and monitor climate risk and impacts.</a><br />
