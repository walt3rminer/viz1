<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">160000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P124724" target=_blank>The objective is to increase the supply of electricity in Bangladesh and strengthen the institutional capacity of the implementing agencies.  Following an unsuccessful procurement of the 300 MW peaking power plants under the original Siddhirganj Peaking Power project, the Borrower decided to proceed with fresh bidding for a 450 MW Combined Cycle Power Plant in view of the severe generation shortfall now gripping Bangladesh. In its letter of September 23, 2010, Government has requested IDA to expand the power station capacity to a combined cycle operation for 450 MW and sought additional financing for about $ 220 million to fill up the financing gap. The combined cycle design would provide 50% more power output per unit of natural gas input. This approach will meet a continuous demand for power of  450 MW, in addition, it will retain power production ability during peak demand periods in conformity with theproject's original objective. It would effectively contribute to the Government's energy shortage mitigation plan. It would also serve to scale up the project's impact and development effectiveness by providing power during both peak and off-peak periods and increasing the usage efficiency of Bangladesh's scarce natural gas resources.</a><br />
