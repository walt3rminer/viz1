<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">150000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P069964" target=_blank>The goal of the Project is to alleviate the imp act of Colombia's current economic crisis on the most vulnerable by protecting and promoting poor children's human capital. This will be accomplished by supporting poor families' investments in their 0-17 children's he alth, nutrition, and education in the face of sharply reduced incomes.  To this effect, the Project supports F amilias en Accion (Families in Action), the family assistance  sub-program of the Government of Colombia's (GO C) new Red de Apoyo Social  (social safety net initiative).  Specifically, the project finances the provision of two kinds of conditional cash transfers to nuclear families in the lowest strata of Colombia's proxy means testing system, SISBEN.  A health and nutrition grant is provided to families with children under 7 continge nt upon bringing them to health centers.  An education grant is provided  to families with school-age children conditional upon school enrollment and attendance.  Through these grants, the Project allows families to avoid coping mechanisms that are damaging to the future earnings of their children such as reducing the intake of nutritious  food and putting children out of school.</a><br />
