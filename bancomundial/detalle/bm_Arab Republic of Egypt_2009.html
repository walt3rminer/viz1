The development objective ties into the active policy of the Government of Egypt on improving skill base, employability and employment opportunities among marginalized youth while promoting inclusion, equity, and reducing disparities in upper and lower Egypt. Moreover,it also takes guidance from the MENA Youth Policy Note which pays special attention to measures for reducing the vulnerability of young workers from rural areas, potential emigrants and disadvantaged youth.</a><br />

The objective of the Project is to enable the 3 Governorates of the Metropolitan to develop their comparative advantages and achieve sustainable development through priority infrastructure investments, land development and tackling key environmental problems. The project will build on principles of public-private partnership and assist selected Governorates to: (a) Apply appropriate programming, financing, and implementation mechanisms to improve economic infrastructure in competitive economic sectors with the expected outcome of attracting private investments and generating employment opportunities; (b) Develop under-utilized land that can be leased/sold or revitalized into more productive uses with the expected outcome of supporting competitive economic sectors, improve local revenue generation and/or support affordable housing supply with the private sector; and (c) Upgrade squatter settlements in partnership with donor agencies with the expected outcome of achieving equitable growth by integrating the poor in the economic growth processes as both contributors and beneficiaries. Through participatory strategic planning process (an application is under preparation for the Cities Alliance Program to assist preparing GCR Strategic Plan and update the Physical Structure Plan), the project will introduce the necessary tools to involve all stakeholders in shaping the Governorates long-term development vision, improve local resource mobilization, and rationalize municipal management and maintenance. 6/22/05 - Draft concept note completed for review meeting pm 1/17/2006.  Joint mission with MNSRE will take place in September 2005 to refine different objectives between IGDP I and IGDP II. 03/07/06.  Project name changed from Integrated Governorates Dev. I to Greater Cairo Development at Country Director's request. Concept review meeting planned for 3/14/06 slipped to 4/24/06. 04/05/06.  Substantial identification work, including preparation of a combined concept note for IDGP1 & IDGP2 was carried out under the original code.  But, during an inter-ministerial committee mtg in Egypt (Feb 2006), the Govt of Egypt decided to merge IDGP1 & IDGP2 resources for the governorates of IDGP2.  Subsequently the Government of Egypt requested a new project (Greater Cairo Development Project) to replace IDGP1 and use all trust fund resources allocated originally to IDGP1, including the PHRD.  The project development objectives remain the same as in the CAS but in a different geographic location/governorates. 05/07/08.  PHRD Grant agreement signed on October 2, 2007 for $720,000 with no disbursements to date.  Substantial preparation work completed for the project, including (a) urban transport strategy for Greater Cairo with identification of key investment needs; (b) detailed assessment of most important proposed investment (Heliopolis tram upgrading and extension to new Cairo City); (c) project idea notes (PINs) for 3 potential carbon finance transactions.  Large amount of coordination work was made with Ministry of Housing, Ministry of Finance and Cairo Governorate.  However, to date we have not received the letter from the Government requesting for the project. The CMU advised the team that no further budget will be allocated for the project until the request is received from the Government. 6/24/09.  On the request of the Government of Egypt (letter dated April 13, 2009, the task team received an approval from the PHRD Unit, LEG and TACT1 to relink the PHRD Grant (TF057140) from this Project (P094230)to P115837, Urban Transport Infrastructure Development Project.
