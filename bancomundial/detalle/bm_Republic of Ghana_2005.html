Specific actions included the following:  * Reducing public domestic debt to increase the credit available to the private sector.  Although fiscal developments in 2004, in particular the need to accommodate the increase in oil prices in international markets, meant a slightly higher overall fiscal deficit than planned, faster real GDP growth allowed the targeted reduction in the domestic debt to be met, with the domestic debt to GDP ratio declining to 15 percent by end-2004, down from 19 percent at end-2003.  Lower levels of domestic public debt and declining inflation allowed, in turn, for nominal interest rates treasury bills to ease to an average of 19 percent in 2004, down from 26 percent in 2003.  Increased availability of credit to the private sector followed suit, and is estimated to have increased by 33 percent in 2004, reaching 55 percent of domestic credit, up from 52 percent at end-2003.  * Diversifying the financial sector, with several actions completed in the implementation of the FINSSIP.  The Long Term Savings Bill was approved by Parliament on October 28, 2004, deepening the savings mobilization for old age and housing.  There were also improvements in the administrative framework for micro-finance, with establishment of an interim committee for the micro-finance center composed of a four member technical committee, which, in consultation with stakeholder beneficiaries, is coordinating the micro-finance services in the country.  Actions are now needed to nominate the members of the Board, so as to formally establish a single entry point for Micro Finance coordination within Government.  Another action related to micro-finance was the publication of a list of all current Government programs in this area, which is being followed up by a census of other interventions being undertaken by private sector and NGOs, making the report more complete.  Finally, the operations of the Central Settlement and Depository System (CSDS) for government securities commenced in November 2004 at the Bank of Ghana, with the set up of the site linkages and the registration of the CSDS as a company.  Still pending, however, is the Parliamentary approval of the CSD Bill, which will provide the necessary legal backing to the operations of the CSDS.  The aim is to record all security transactions in electronic form, increasing the liquidity and reducing the costs of transactions in government securities, especially for small investors.  * Continuing the implementation of the power sector reform, with additional efforts made in restructuring the energy sector to encourage efficiency and the quality of service delivery.  The automatic mechanism for adjusting energy tariffs remained operational, although no adjustments were required because of the shift in the electricity generation mix toward less expensive hydroelectric sources.Progress was also made in commencing the implementation of a five-year performance-based ECG Management Support Services Agreements (MSSAs), with the issuance of the Request for Proposals (RfP) to the qualified bidders on June 9, 2005, setting a July 19 deadline for receiving technical and financial proposals.  Also, progress was made in continuing the process of transforming the Volta River Authority (VRA) into two separate companies (the distribution and the generations companies), and the establishment of an independent transmission company, with the VRA Amendments act approved by Parliament on July 22, 2004.  In the meantime, VRA?s Assets Revaluation was completed, and consultants were engaged to separ</a><br />
