<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P124663" target=_blank>Project will support the creation of a Program within the Caixa Economica Federal do Brazil, through which Caixa will be able to identify, prepare and partially finance emission reduction activities under solid waste management projects and sell the resulting emissions reductions credits.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">40000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P112043" target=_blank>The objective is to improve the protection, conservation and sustainable development of indigenous lands with respect to indigenous peoples and natural resources.  A new operation Brazil Indigenous Peoples Sustainable Development would be prepared with the client, Fundacao Nacional do Indio (FUNAI).  The new operation would build on previous operations especially the Pilot Program to Conserve the Brazilian Rain Forest Indigenous Lands Project that helped legalize 40 million hectares of indigenous lands inn the Amazon. This follow on operation would focus on addressing two of the main challenges that still are critical for the futures of indigenous peoples in Brazil: (1) How best to protect and sustainably manage their lands and natural resources, and (2) how best to protect and promote the well-being of indigenous people to both ensure their welfare and to help them determine their owns paths toward economic change cosnsistent with their socio-cultural values. The new operation would be financed by an investment loan from the World Bank (currently estimated at $40 m.), a grant from KfW/Germany (currently estimated at $10 m.), and counterpart funds (currently estimated at 40 percent). Although still in the identification phase, a recent brainstorming on the new operation preliminarily identified the following components: (1) Institutional Strengthening; (2) Improving Public Policies and Interinstitutional Links; (3) Territorial Protection; and (4) Promotion of Sustainable Development.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">485000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P122391" target=_blank>The objective of the proposed operation is to support the state government of Rio de Janeiro (GORJ) to strengthen its policies for planning and managing territorial growth in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region (Regiao Metropolitana de Rio de Janeiro, RMRJ), promoting the provision of affordable housing, and creating integrated social development programs targeted at the urban poor.  The proposed operation is fully consistent with and closely linked to the objectives of the Brazil CPS, 2008-2011.  In particular, through its prior actions, the DPL will strengthen local governance at the metropolitan level; boost competitiveness by supporting mechanisms that facilitate infrastructure development; improve environmental sustainability by protecting natural resources and assets; andincrease equity by reaching out to the most vulnerable.</a><br />
