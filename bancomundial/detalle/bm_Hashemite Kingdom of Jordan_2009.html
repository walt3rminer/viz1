The Board Date slipped by two weeks at the request of the GOJ. Proposed Loan Amount was also modified based on the positive response of the Crisis Working Group to bring the DPL to $300 mln.

The project would add about [400] MW of additional power to the system, help to ensure the reliability of power supply, and help maintain a margin between available capacity and demand of at least [10] percent. The purpose of the IBRD Guarantee is to enhance competition and therefore help reduce the project's financing costs.</a><br />

The Government of Jordan has requested World Bank assistance with implementation of its food security strategy. The objective of the strategy is to ensure that sufficient quantities of nutritionally appropriate and affordable food are accessible to the population, particularly the poor. One cornerstone of the strategy, and the focus of this note, is the expansion and management of strategic grain reserves. The rapid increase in international food prices in 2007 and early 2008 raised concerns about food security in Jordan. Ninety-seven percent of the domestically consumed grain is imported. Approximately 37 percent by volume is wheat for human consumption and 44 percent is barley (23 percent) and maize (21 percent) for animal feed. Jordan is severely constrained in terms of water and land resources, and there is little if no opportunity to increase domestic production of cereals. The combination of thin international markets, regional security risks, and potentially volatile international food prices all contribute to the GoJs desire to ensure it has satisfactory strategic food reserves in place for the coming decades. The recent food-price shock was associated with low levels of international supply that were exacerbated by export bans by some countries. Difficulty in securing supply coupled with security risks in the area around the country's only port on the Red sea (Aqaba), raise further concerns about reliability of supply. The 2008 food-price shock also appears closely correlated with retail food prices and poverty. The poor spend 40 percent of their budget on food and preliminary evidence suggests that from 2006 to 2008 there was a four percentage point increase in the number of people below the poverty line. Recent events have contributed to a revision in the strategic grain reserve policy. Jordan's policy was conceived in the 1980s when 370,000 MT of grain storage infrastructure was put in place in four facilities to cover the needs of close to three million people. An additional 100,000 MT of storage infrastructure was added in the early 1990s. Since 1980, the population has doubled and it is expected to reach almost nine million by 2030. The projection in Annex I shows that existing storage capacity is sufficient for slightly over four months of wheat and barley consumption.  The GoJ intends to increase the physical reserve to 10 months for wheat.  This will require expansion of storage facilities by 320,000 MT, taking into account population growth for the next decade.  This does not include potential reserves of barley or maize. The GoJ proposal to increase physical reserves is part of a comprehensive national strategy to improve food security. The approach is consistent with the third pillar of the strategy laid out in the recently completed World Bank, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Fund for Agriculture and Development position paper "Improving Food Security in Arab Countries" and the World Bank's Global Food Price Crisis Response Program. The project objective is to expand the size and improve the management of the Government's strategic grain reserves. 4/21/09.  Minutes of review meeting held 4/15/09 issued today.  The peer reviewers were Alan Piazza (Senior Economist, EASRE) and Marc Sadler (Senior Agriculture Economist, ARD). A preparation mission is scheduled from May 4-May 15, 2009. Project will be dropped due to increasing concerns regarding the Government's debt capacity.</a><br />

The project will support policy reforms that will: (i) improve the Government's capacity to diversify and improve financing mechanisms; (ii) modernize the governance and management efficacy of the sector; and (iii) strengthen quality assurance and accreditation mechanisms.</a><br />
