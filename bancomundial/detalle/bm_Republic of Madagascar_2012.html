Those objectives are to support the Government of Madagascar?s efforts to promote a multi-sectoral response to the HIV/AIDS crisis and to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS on its territory.  To do so, the project will intensify and will build capacity to carry out the national response to HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), a key risk factor for and contributor to the spread of HIV/AIDS.   In addition, the MSPPII will seek to improve the quality of life of persons living with HIV/AIDS through increased access to quality medical care and to non-medical support services.  Given the current epidemiological situation, the project will put an even stronger focus than the original project on at-risk groups in high prevalence areas,  while moderately expanding services to other affected groups (e.g., orphans and other vulnerable children). To increase utilization of STI/HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health and nutrition services in the project area.</a><br />

More specifically, the program aims at building the capacity of communes to manage public resources and to coordinate with de-concentrated technical administrations through the financing of local infrastructure. This is expected to improve both the quantity and quality of the services provided to the population. Another objective of the program is to harmonize donorâs support to local government development and to support Madagascarâs decentralization process.   The program development objective is the provision of capacity building and the financing of basic infrastructure at the local level. The program aims at enhancing the capacity of communes to utilize participatory and transparent planning, budgeting and monitoring systems and work with STDs to improve service delivery.
