In addition, the GPOBA grant will finance two energy efficient Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) for poor households (hhs). Those CFLs will be delivered as part of the connection package to both ensure an affordable bill for hhs and promote energy efficiency. The increased access to electricity will improve the quality of life, enhance educational services, and provide income-generating opportunities.</a><br />
