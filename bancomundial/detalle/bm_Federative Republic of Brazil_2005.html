This development objective is aligned with the Millennium Development Goals MDGs (especially Goal 7, Target 11) in line with the growing number of governments around the world that are launching comprehensive slum upgrading programs, setting development targets, undertaking reforms to prevent the growth of new slums, and leveraging public and private resources to improve the lives of slum dwellers.</a><br />

Furthermore, the project supports development of an international market mechanism for "Emission Reductions" (ER), under the framework of the Kyoto Protocol.  Although the PDO has not changed since project approval in June 2005, the implementing agency has modified the original project design (in order to expand its operations due to the natural course of business).  As a result, a decision to submit a revised PDD (Project Design Document) to the CDM Board is being considered since the project no longer conforms to its original design.</a><br />

The amended ERPA targets to purchase 1,000,000 tons by Dec. 2012</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">8000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P090041" target=_blank>The main objective of the proposed EnvTAL is to support the Government on advancing the pace of reforms on the sustainability agenda program defined in the Policy Letter presented by the government on July 7, 2004, focusing on the targets set forth for the second EnvPRL operation. The Letter is referred to in the First Programmatic Reform Loan for Environmental Sustainability project document (Bank Report no. 28650-BR).</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">54350000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P093787" target=_blank>The Project would increase social and economic opportunities for the rural poor in Bahia by improving their access to basic socioeconomic infrastructure, thus contributing to the Borrower's objective of increasing the HDI. While building on the CDD approach proven successful under the first phase of Produzir, the second phase would improve on this experience by:  (a) integrating with and/or complementing activities of other Bank loans for the State (under the Bahia State Program), particularly the PGRH and Viver Melhor Urbano II;  (b) strengthening the cross-sectoral integration and providing significantly more emphasis on education, health, culture, natural resources management and environmental sustainability; and (c) scaling up the impact on poverty by using the skills, social capital and experience of the Municipal Councils and community associations to improve the relevance, efficiency, sustainability, targeting and outcomes of non-project State and Federal investments in rural Bahia.</a><br />

Specifically, the expected outcomes of the project are: (a) improved water quality of the Vicente Pires and Descoberto Rivers; (b) improved living conditions in targeted low-income settlements by providing integrated urban environmental services; and (c) strengthened technical and institutional capacity, contributing to development of the Brasilia metropolitan region.</a><br />

The specific development objectives are to: (a) Enhance monitoring processes and systems, including the systematic collection of thorough data on social indicators, to permit: (i) stronger, more integrated and continuous assessment of progress on social programs and policies, and (ii) use of performance information in resource allocation decision-making; (b) Support the development of systematic research and evaluation of the impact of  health, education and social protection policies and reforms as a means toward institutionalizing a results-oriented culture of accountability in public organizations responsible for social sector service delivery; and (c) Support the institutional reform agenda as specified by the HD PSRL.</a><br />
