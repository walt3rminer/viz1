The objective shall be achieved by updating their management plans and implementing the corresponding measures, including if such option is confirmed by establishing a NGO Biodiversity Resource and Research Centre on Praslin island, the second largest island in Seychelles, only 2km away from Cousin, 3 km from Cousine and 6km from Aride and by funding scientific & education officers and local counterparts.  An important objective of the improved management plans will be to reduce human pressure in order to remove threats of pollution, intensive human use and loss of naturalness. This would be achieved by limiting the numbers of permanent staff, researchers and their equipment to a minimum on each island and by improving the management of the flow of visitors. Another objective will be to promote more research, education and awareness activities as well as maximise the use of scarce human resources to benefit all three islands through the exchange of staff and collaboration on joint programs. The establishment of new facilities such as the Praslin Centre would thus improves delivery to a broader array of stakeholders, whilst improving the sustainable use of the islands.   Praslin is well situated for the housing the Biodiversity Resource and Research Centre.  Praslin is a tourist resort island and it is served by air and surface links and has excellent communications and utilities.
