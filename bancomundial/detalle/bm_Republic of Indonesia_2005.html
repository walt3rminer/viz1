The first DPL for $300 million was approved by the Board on December 21, 2004, based on implementation of key policy actions in Indonesia's "White Paper."  DPL 2 builds on those policy actions, supporting deeper reforms in the core areas of macroeconomic stability, investment climate, and public financial management / anti-corruption, while also addressing new areas deemed critical by the government, in line with its evolving medium-term reform strategy. The DPL is based on a programmatic approach to policy based lending.  As such, it was designed to provide annual financing in recognition and support of successful reform implementation in three core policy areas: (i) macroeconomic stability; (ii) public financial management and anti-corruption; and (iii) the investment climate.  Each DPL is expected to build on the previous operation; hence, reforms in a policy area deepen and broaden as the program progresses.  However, while the programmatic approach typically anchors programs to a coherent medium-term framework, the Indonesia DPL program was designed to ensure continuity of reform implementation in the midst of a political and policy transition, during which a medium-term framework would develop.  DPL 1, therefore, was anchored to the previous government's "White Paper" and the new government's "100 day plan". DPL 2 is based on the "100 day plan", medium-term agenda, the Government's annual action plan and emerging policy statements DPL 2 was included in the CAS as part of the high-case lending scenario.  Broadly speaking, reaching the high case requires continuation of reforms in the DPL core policy areas as well as further progress in justice sector reform and improved service delivery to the poor.  Table 1 summarizes progress made and indicates overlap between DPL and CAS reform areas.  The CAS outlined indicative "triggers", or reforms and policy improvements, which were derived from a subset of key measures in the White Paper.  The triggers represent key benchmarks that signal adequate progress in the reform program to justify moving to the high case. Board Schedule Comments The Bank's assessment is that Indonesia has made sufficient progress in each CAS outcome area to warrant the consideration of a DPL 2.  The overall reform program remains broadly on track and the government is expected to make sufficient progress by October 2005, to allow a DPL 2 to disburse before the end of 2005, as requested by the government.  On specific triggers, it is important to underscore that progress across the different outcome areas has been uneven.  While the government has made substantially more progress than originally expected on macroeconomic stability, investment climate, and creditworthiness, fulfillment of specific triggers related to decentralization and public financial management has been slower.  Nevertheless, key benchmarks in these areas are likely to be met before appraisal</a><br />
