They are essentially similar to those under the predecessor project. Thus, complementing the activities financed by other sources, the purpose is to help Benin Government implement its new 2006-2010 National Strategic Framework for boosting its national response to HIV/AIDS by contributing to increase and improve the coverage and utilization of prevention services, treatment and care for specific high-risk and vulnerable groups. More specifically, the project will contribute to: (a) strengthening access to and increasing utilization of prevention services for vulnerable groups (women, youth, etc.) and the high-risk groups such as the commercial sex workers and staffs of some key ministries; (b) improve access and utilization of treatment and care services for HIV/AIDS infected and affected persons, notably those living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and orphans and vulnerable children (OVC); and (c) consolidate the coordination, management, and the monitoring and evaluation of the national response to HIV/AIDS for its sustainability.</a><br />
