The change of animal waste management practice as well as energy saving through coal replacement could result in GHG emission reduction. The project proposes to select 140,000 households located in 44 counties listed as the lest developed counties or relatively poor county in Shandong.  The current deep pit to store animal waste before land application will be replaced by biogas digesters. Meanwhile, the methane generated by proposed project will be used for cooking and lighting. The installation of biogas digester will be combined with improvement on toilet, kitchen and sty (Three-Improvements model), a systematic improvement of rural household hygiene conditions that is promoted by government program.

The objective of the China Power Sector Transformer Efficiency Program (the Project) is to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions ofChina’s power industry by reducing distribution system losses. This will be accomplished through the expanded adoption of non-mandatory energy efficient transformers as part of sector modernization in distribution networks of SGCC. To ensure adequate scale for national impact and to place the carbon finance transaction on a financially viable footing, the Carbon Finance Operation will pool a number of replacement activities under the distribution networks of 15 provincial subsidiaries of SGCC in a single agreement and SGCC as intermediary is responsible for managing the carbon finance transaction.</a><br />
