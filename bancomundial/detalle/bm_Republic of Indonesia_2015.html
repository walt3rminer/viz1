The proposed operation, in the amount of US$ 500 million, is the first in a planned programmatic series of two single-tranche operations supporting critical policy and institutional reforms that have four key development objectives: A) reducing the fiscal cost of electricity provision; B) improving the investment climate in the energy sector; C) removing constraints to renewable energy expansion D) expanding access to modern, reliable energy.</a><br />

The strengthening of the enabling environment, supported by the GEF grant, isexpected to incentivize local banks to undertake EE financing in the large enterprises sector resulting in significant energy savings.</a><br />

The project will focus on three key aspects: integrated tourism masterplanning, private sectordevelopment, and the creation of basic tourism infrastructure. Through this intervention, the project is expected to help build the foundation for the Bali-Nusa Tenggara (NTB) corridor to become the “gateway to tourism” as outlined in Indonesia’s Masterplan forAcceleration of Economic Development (MP3EI). The project is expected to create jobs in the sector and contribute to preservation and management of Indonesia’s prime tourism assets. In the longer term, the project is expected to develop a mechanism for replicating integrated tourism planning and development throughout Indonesia as a driver for sustainable and inclusive growth. This would help the GOI reach its goal of promoting equity across regions and reduce poverty in some of its poorest provinces such as NTB.</a><br />

This will be done by applying the Eco2 Cities principles in participating cities and focusing on two components, namely: i) Catalyst investments that promote both economic development and ecological sustainability. ii) Analytical Support and Institutional Strengthening (TA) to support capacity building for each participating city to develop their Eco2 Cities framework, improve planning, budgeting, and design of investment priorities, as well as carry out analytical studies on urban expansion, metropolitan management, and land use planning.</a><br />

The project development objective (PDO) is to increase service coverage and improve water supply and sanitation services in selected LGs and PDAMs. This will be achieved through the establishment of a facility that could be accessed by LGs and PDAMs thatare not eligible for accessing existing funding mechanisms . The facility could provide funding for investments as well as technicalassistance and capacity building activities to improve the performance of PDAMs and LGs in water and sanitation services delivery.</a><br />
