DPO-3 emphasizes the second objective, to sustain the economic recovery and prepare the conditions for post-crisis growth.  In addition to a satisfactory macroeconomic and fiscal framework, themain policy areas supported are: (i) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public finances; (ii) improving the effectiveness of the social safety net; and (iii) improving external competitiveness.</a><br />

The expected impact is to increase the number of mobile applications entrepreneurs in the ECA region. The expected intermediate results are the hosting of events to promote innovation in the mobile sphere, targeting around 1000 participants from 400 or so companies, NGOs, government agencies and other organizations that would participate in the online and offline activities, and promoting the visibility of the  chapters at a global level, for instance through a dedicated webspace and competitions with winners to gain entry to international events, such as infoDev's Global Forum for Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Helsinki (30 May - 3 June 2011). The main knowledge output of this activity will be inputs to the Mobile Flagship Report (GLO 1 under TF071399) to evaluate lessons learned from this experiment in social networking and to show the development potential of mobile applications.</a><br />
