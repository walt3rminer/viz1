The formally revised project objectives are: (a) to contain and mitigate the imp act of the outbreak of FMD in the Borrower#s territory through: (i) vaccination of cattle; (ii) strengthening of the monitoring and surveillance capacity of the  Borrower to prevent future outbreaks from spreading beyond the directly affecte d area; and (iii) identification of alternative markets for the beef produced in  the Borrower#s territory in the short-run and restoring the Borrower#s presence  in the premium beef market in the long-run; and (b) to prevent the introduction  of other trans-boundary animal diseases of large economic importance.</a><br />

The delivery of ERs to the Bank according to the delivery schedule agreed upon in the Emissions Reductions Purchase Agreement (ERPA) will be the results indicator that is going to be monitored by the Bank over time.</a><br />
