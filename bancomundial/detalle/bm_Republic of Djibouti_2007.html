Detailed engineering design and related estimates have confirmed the need of $ 2m additional financing. This was formally requested by the Government, and approved by Bank management. June 22, 2007 This additional financing was submitted to the Board in October 2006 as a credit, as per instructions of the Country Unit. However, given the macro-economic situation of Djibouti, FRM instructed the Region to cancel the credit and re-submit the Additional Financing as a grant. Hence this code is being dropped.</a><br />

In additio n, the project aims to improve the living conditions in the resettlement zone to which Government has relocated the families whose h ousing was destroyed in the flood-prone area through delivery of basic infrastructure services. Finally, the project plans to build  the capacity for long-term disaster prevention and management, and support employment generation for the low-income population, esp ecially from the affected areas through reliance, where feasible, on labor intensive works.</a><br />
