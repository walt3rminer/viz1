This will be achieved through: (i) the detailed design of pilot adaptation measures to reduce expected negative impacts of climate change on marine and terrestrial biodiversity and land degradation; and (ii) the implementation of pilot daptation investments. Reducing these impacts will primarily result in protection of biodiversity and prevention of land degradation but will also induce economic benefits in the tourism, fisheries, agriculture and forestry sectors, help maintain the resource base upon which these economic activities rely and promote climate resilient sustainable development. More importantly, the experience gained through these local level activities will assist and inform the policy decision making process and is expected to influence the enactment of climate resilient sustainable development policies.</a><br />
