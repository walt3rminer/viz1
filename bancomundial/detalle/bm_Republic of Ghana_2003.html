Specific elements of the strategy include enhancing the existing infrastructure and support services; reforming the organization and financing of the health system and increasing overall financing for the sector; strengthening management information systems, and in particular improving financial managment and monitoring of performance of the system; developing human resources for the sector; strengthening links with traditional and alternative medicine; and fostering partnerships with other stakeholders.</a><br />
