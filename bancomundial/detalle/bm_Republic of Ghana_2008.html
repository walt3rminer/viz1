<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P098663" target=_blank>This project will convert an existing power plant in Takoradi, Ghana from single-cycle to combined cycle, enabling the waste heat from two generators to produce steam to generate another 110 MW turbine.  The result will be converting the plant from 220 MW to 330 MW, providing additional electricity for the same amount of fossil fuel input.  The project will help Ghana meet its growing energy needs, which can only be met by adding fossil fuel plants.  Currently, this waste heat is not being used, but this project will install an additional 110 MW heat recovery steam generator, which will utilize the waste heat to product steam, turn a turbine and provide additional power with no additional fuel input.  The current generators can use oil or gas but is currently using light crude oil from Nigeria.</a><br />

The objectives of this first DPO series are to: (a) ensure predictable and sustainable financing of the forest and wildlife sectors and effective forest law enforcement; (b) improve mining sector revenue collection, management, and transparency; (c) address social issues in forest and mining communities; and (d) integrate environmental considerations across sectors supporting growth through Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), and an inter-sectoral climate change strategy.</a><br />
