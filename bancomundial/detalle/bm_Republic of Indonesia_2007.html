<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">600000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P105637" target=_blank>Project Development Objective (Note: will be disclosed in the MOS) DPL 4 is the last in a series of DPLs in this CAS period. DPL1 (US$ 300 million) was endorsed by the board in December 2004, DPL2 (US$ 400 million) in December 2005, and DPL3 (US$ 600 million). Following strong government request, the updated CAS (approved by the board in October 2006) increased the share and volume of the World Bank's policy based lending.  DPL4 is based on policy reforms in three critical areas: (i) Investment Climate; (ii) Public Financial management & Anti-Corruption; and (iii) Service Delivery. The triggers in these three areas are based on the government's reform program and are underpinned by World Bank AAA. Board Schedule Comments All previous DPLs have been disbursed at the end of each calendar year (which coincides with the Indonesian fiscal year). This loan will again be one of the largest in EAP since the financial crisis, and may thus warrant in itself full Board discussion. In addition, the government, supported by the Bank, has launched a very ambitious poverty program and this DPL will also prepare the groundwork for a new series of DPLs focussed on poverty and service delivery.</a><br />
