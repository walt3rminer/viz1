<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P133554" target=_blank>The objectives of the proposed activity will focus on four areas: (i) developing and implementing new methodologies for the financi al and performance audits of the state budget, state social insurance budget and compulsory health insurance funds, accounting for s everal reforms recently undertaken currently by the Government; (ii) enhancing HR and performance systems for more effective develop ment and deployment of human resources on audit engagements; (iii) enhancing the capacity of conducting an effective audit of IT-bas ed financial systems and obtaining specialized skills to conduct other types of IT audits; and (iv) development of quality control s ystems.  The CoA is keen to enter into a twinning arrangement with one of the recent entrants to the EU (Baltic countries) given com monality of size and scope of government, culture, legacy systems and language and that these countries have successfully met EU ben chmarks (the acquis communitaire) for external audit.    The proposed activities will continue the efforts started under the technic al assistance provided by the World Bank in support to the CoA which came to its end in 2011, and resulted in achievement of substan tive and significant results across all strategic goals set forth for that period.  The results expected to be achieved through impl ementation of these activities are (i) comprehensive and high quality audit of the Government's accounts based on a new audit method ology; (ii) enhanced professionalism of CoA staff in performance audit and IT audit techniques; (iii) increased awareness of the sta keholders about the topics of public interest.</a><br />
