However, it is useful to note the  following.   The Project, which was originally conceived as an APL, was also meant to prepare  the APL 2 whose development objective was to consolidate the Free Zone (FZ) fun ctions and financing, and secure managerial and financial autonomy for GIPFZA. T his phase [would have] also deepened the production linkages of the FZ with the local economy.  However, the idea of an APL 2 was dropped from the Country Assis tance Strategy since this instrument no longer corresponds to the country's need s in terms of growth and competitiveness.  While the PDO is maintained, a first order restructuring was completed including :  (i) formally close component 3: Support to the Gambia Divestiture Agency and reallocate the funds of this underperforming component to a new component; (ii) formally close component 4: Capacity Building, to further focus the project#s sc ope; (iii) add a component: Preparatory work for the Divestiture of the Groundnu t sector, to meet an urgent Government request to help improve the performance o f the groundnut sector; (iv) restructure the Results Framework so that it is mor e focused, simpler and easier to use as a monitoring and evaluation tool; and (v ) funds are reallocated across categories.</a><br />
