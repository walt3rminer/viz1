PRSC-6 is the third in a series of three annual operations supporting the implementation of Burkina Faso#s second Poverty Reduction Strategy in 2004-2006.  PRSC-6 has three components consistent with the four PRSP pillars: (i) growth and employment creation; (ii) human resource development; and (iii) good governance.  Under the growth and employment creation component, PRSC-6 supports reforms in the rural, telecommunication, and energy sectors as well as on investment climate (labor market, regulatory framework) to lower factor costs, increase productivity and favor new investments. The second component includes policies in the education, health, social protection and water infrastructure, to lower the cost of services, increase access, improve service quality, and reinforce monitoring and evaluation.  The third component encompasses policy measures to strengthen budget formulation, budget execution, procurement, budget management and ex-post control, public sector reform and decentralization, and environmental management.  PRSC-6 aims to allow the Government to pursue its policy objectives laid out in the revised PRSP and its accompanying Priority Action Plan (PAP) within a structured macroeconomic framework by providing sound financing for the execution of the Government#s 2006 budget. Over the period 2004-2006, it is expected that the reform program under the series of three annual PRSCs (PRSC-4, PRSC-5 and PRSC-6) would help the Government in achieving a 6 percentage point reduction of the poverty headcount. It would also help the Government in making progress toward reaching some key Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), namely, school enrollment, literacy, child and maternal mortality, and access to safe water. Lastly, expected benefits include strengthening the sustainability of development efforts, better governance through improved public financial management and modern civil service, and improved services delivery through greater deconcentration and decentralization.</a><br />
