<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">20000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P007077" target=_blank>The main objectives of the project are to strengthen the capacity of Participati ng Provinces (PPs) to manage the rural road network, and to provide improved acc ess to markets and social services for residents of poor rural areas.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">60000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P098167" target=_blank>The broad objectives of the Bono de Desarrollo Humano program (BDH) are to reduc e poverty and promote human capital investments among poor families through the provision of direct monetary transfers and incentives for households to invest i n human capital. World Bank assistance under the proposed APL would aim to contr ibute to these ultimate objectives of poverty reduction and human capital develo pment among poor families.   Within that broader context, the development objective of the proposed APL is to  consolidate the role of the BDH as a conditional cash transfer program and of S elBen as a targeting tool for social programs, while supporting the development of an effective country social protection strategy to reduce poverty and to fost er investments in human capital among poor households.  The program will help su stain and strengthen the well-established and reasonably successful BDH program and will help ensure protection of the fiscal space for the monetary transfers m ade under the BDH to poor families.  Phase 1 of the APL would support the transformation of the BDH into an effective  cash transfer program that protects the vulnerable and fosters investment by po or families in human capital.  #Effectiveness# would be assessed in terms of:  ( i) the targeting and coverage of benefits; (ii) efficacy of the transfer and co- responsibilities to foster investment by beneficiary families in human capital; and (iii) the capacities of involved institutions (including PPS staff, sectoral  ministries, service providers, and beneficiary groups) to manage the program ef ficiently, to monitor results, and to evaluate impacts.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">90000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P088575" target=_blank>The main objective of the proposed project is to assist the GOE to extend health  coverage to targeted low-income groups who otherwise have no access to health c are with the goal of reducing infant, child and maternal mortality, as well as r educing the level of health inequalities between provinces and income quintiles.   The APL would finance the implementation of PROAUS, extending health insurance  coverage to individuals in income quintiles 1 and 2 over a period of 8 years or  less.  In the first phase of the APL, PROAUS coverage would be initially extend ed to 860,000 individuals in income quintiles 1 and 2 living in the municipaliti es of Quito and Guayaquil, as well as those living in Canton Santa Elena and fro m the provinces of Tunguragua, Cotopaxi, Chimborazo and Bolivar.  By the end of the implementation of APL1, 1.4 million people would be covered and served by PR OAUS.  Extending coverage should be accompanied by an 8 percent reduction in IMR  and U5MR, and by 12 percent in MMR in enrolled populations in project provinces  and municipalities, as well as 5 percent reductions in the ratios of IMR, U5MR and MMR between 1-2 and 4-5 income quintiles. The project would contribute subst antially to Ecuadorâs ability to meet the MDGs for health by 2015.  The project should also meet a secondary but similarly important objective of ch anging the operational culture of the health care systems. The implementation of  this project should provide a new incentive framework through new payment arran gements and a more market-driven approach to the contracting of services by the AUS Corporation, promoting operational effectiveness, quality improvements and e fficiency.  The project should also set the correct incentives for enrollment, m onitoring and actual delivery of services.  By the end of APL Phase 1, contracts  including this new incentive framework would be signed with the municipalities of Quito and Guayaquil, and with providers in at least 4 provinces.  Further, th e project should also contribute to the process of decentralization in the healt h sector by transferring responsibility to contract services from the MOH to the  AUS Corporation and to selected municipalities.   Lastly, the project should contribute to strengthening the monitoring, evaluatio n and audit network of PROAUS.  This would include the strengthening of the Heal th Management Information Network for both the AUS Corporation and its providers , as well as supporting external financial and technical audit.</a><br />
