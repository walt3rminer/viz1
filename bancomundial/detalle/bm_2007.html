This includes assistance to the Government in continuing to implement its 2005 Priority Action Plan for public expenditure management reforms, and developing and implementing its 2006 Priority Action Plan.  These reforms include improving  the alignment of the 2006 budget to the priorities of the PRSP, the reform of the Treasury, the installation of a transitional integrated financial management system, taking steps to make the new procurement code operational, and the preparation of draft budget execution laws (Projet de loi de reglement).  Following the operationalization of the Anti-Corruption Agency (BIANCO), PRSC 3 deepens support for the Government#s anti-corruption agenda. It  also supports the implementation of a reform program for customs. PRSC 3 consolidates support to the strategic axis of providing human and material security, by supporting the Government Education for All Agenda and improving service delivery in nutrition, health and rural water supply.</a><br />

Over the period 2004-2006, it is expected that the reform program under the series of three annual PRSCs (PRSC-4, PRSC-5 and PRSC-6) would help the Government in achieving a 6 percentage point reduction of the poverty headcount. It would also help the Government in making progress toward reaching some key Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), namely, school enrollment, literacy, child and maternal mortality, and access to safe water. Lastly, expected benefits include strengthening the sustainability of development efforts, better governance through improved public financial management and modern civil service, and improved services delivery through greater deconcentration and decentralization.</a><br />
