Objectives of the reform program supported by the BAC are to reduce those administrative and regulatory barriers that would have the most critical near-term impact on the three phases of business development: (i) improving   business entry    through streamlined and transparent countrywide approach to business registration and licensing and strengthened legal framework and capacity for attracting foreign investment; (ii) streamlining the environment for   business operations    by reducing companies' administrative and regulatory compliance costs through rationalization of inspections and regulations, strengthening of judicial and extra-judicial capacity to resolve commercial disputes; improving enforcement of secured transactions; and leveling the playing field for private sector participation in public procurement, and (iii) facilitating   business exit    through improved bankruptcy and liquidation systems.  Underlying these objectives is the need to strengthen the consultative capacity between the public and private sectors to promote policies and legislation that are business-friendly. While the Credit is expected to have significant short-term results in improving the business enabling environment and promoting increased private sector activity, sustained efforts to ensure the effective implementation of the reforms will be required to build up long-term investor confidence in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The key is to initiate critical changes that lead to strong momentum toward a self-sustaining process of improving the investment climate.</a><br />
