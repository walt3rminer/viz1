This will be achieved through: (i) developing the sector's institutional, policy and regulatory framework;  (ii) rehabilitating two current municipal disposal sites, that operate without sanitary conditions, to function as properly designed regional sanitary landfills;  (iii) closing current disposal sites in an environmentally acceptable manner;  (iv) provision of modern collection equipment;  (v) initiating a pilot recycling campaign;  and (vi) strengthening multi-municipal joint companies (MJC) that will be created to operate the two regional solid waste disposal systems.</a><br />
