<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P067803" target=_blank>This project is consistent with the GEF Forest Ecosystem operational program (OP#3), it responds to priorities in key Indonesian conservation strategies, namely The National Conservation Plan for Indonesia, the Biodiversity Action Plan for Indonesia as well as two of the primary objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity: conservation and sustainable use. With respect to Sangihe and Karakelang, and on a small-scale, this project will apply emerging principles of the ecosystem approach, adopted by the CBD. Because Sangihe is a cultural landscape with no existing protected area, and threats derive locally, we propose an integrated landscape approach. On Talaud there is already a protected area and threats derive from higher level policy we propose a more traditional protected area management approach. For Sangihe, the project will seek to strengthen protection, and increase local-level support for an area of protection forest because of its ecosystem services,as an alternative strategy to the establishment of a conventional nature reserve or sanctuary. The success of such an approach would be of immense relevance to other areas of biodiversity importance in Indonesia, which are currently classified as watershed protection forest and at present lie outside the country#s protected area network. For Karakelang, Talaud, the project has already achieved a change in status of an existing reserve and will build on this to strengthen protection and support government agencies in their management work. A Public Awareness Programme will be implemented linking the two sites and addressing the social and cultural context in which their management is embedded. The conservation education campaign will employ social marketing techniques to build awareness and pride in the islands# unique biodiversity, as well as the importance of forest resources. It will adapt the RARE approach to conservation which has been successful on other small tropical islands outside Indonesia and build upon people#s strong sense of island identity. This campaign aims to significantly increase levels of public and government support for conservation activities and future initiatives on Sangihe and Karakelang. This project will work in close collaboration with the Regency authorities and local parliament. The local bupati has already shown strong commitment and support for conservation efforts and support from the kabupaten government will be crucial to achieving the project#s objectives, especially on Sangihe. As the process of decentralization in Indonesia unfolds, this project will have much wider relevance as a model in demonstrating the workability of conservation initiatives and responsibilities at local government level.</a><br />

The major portion of the investments under (b) to (d) will be in Lombok, while the remainder (about 15%) will be in Sumbawa.   This project is now foreseen as an APL in 3 tranches.</a><br />

The c hallenge is to initiate key sector reforms and put health financing on a  firm footing, while protecting healt h services which are  essential for the poor anf the  public at large  during a period of government restructu ring. The second objective is to help the Ministry of Health carry out  its role in a decentralized system. Th ese responsibilities encompass providing sectoral vision and leadership,  analysis and policy follow up of the health needs of the poor and risks to the public at large, advocacy of best practices and standards, and support for local initiative.</a><br />
