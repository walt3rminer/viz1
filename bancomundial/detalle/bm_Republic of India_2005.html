Stephen Howes is the co-task leader of this project. Board Schedule Comments The Bank appraised the Third Karnataka Economic Restructuring Loan/Credit (KERL3) in October 2003. However, the Government of India (GoI) subsequently refused to allow negotiations because it was not satisfied with Karnataka's fiscal performance. More recent data for 2003/04 has led to a change in GoI's position, and the Bank has been asked to revive KERL3 and proceed with the next steps. Following the stock-taking mission to Bangalore in mid-November 2004 to review Government of Karnataka's progress with the Karnataka Economic Restructuring Program, this program was appraised again during January 24-28, 2005.</a><br />
