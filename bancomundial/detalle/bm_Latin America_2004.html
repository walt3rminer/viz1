<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P077187" target=_blank>The Inter-American Biodiversity Information Network (IABIN) was officially mandated at the Summit of the Americas on Sustainable Development, convened in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, in December 1996. To support the development of IABIN, this GEF project seeks to: (i) consolidate the development of this Internet-based, decentralized network to provide wider access to scientifically credible biodiversity information currently existing in individual institutions and agencies in the Americas, (ii) provide the tools necessary to draw knowledge from that wealth of resources, which in turn will support sound decision-making concerning the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.</a><br />
