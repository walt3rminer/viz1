<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">75000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P118713" target=_blank>The Third Programmatic Environmental Development Policy Loan Program (ENVDPL 3) continues to support the government?s efforts to strengthen environmental governance and institutions in Peru, and mainstream environmental sustainability in the development agenda of key sectors (mining, fisheries, and urban transport and energy). Within the scope of the ENVDPL program, this third ENVDPL is consistent with one of the key pillars of the 2006 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Peru for FY07-FYI1 (and the 2009 CPS progress report) laying out a strategy to support the Government of Peru (GoP) to achieve its goals of sustained economic growth. The CPS recognizes the need to raise the profile of environmental issues in Peru by enhancing environmental public investments and strengthening the institutional framework. In support of CPS pillar (I) on economic growth, the ENVDPL program will contribute to making growth environmentally sustainable by supporting the environmental legal and institutional framework, biodiversity conservation, enhancing control over air and water pollution, improving the sustainability of the mining sector, and the  sustainable management of fisheries resources. In addition, by supporting the policy instruments of the recently created Ministry of Environment (MINAM), the ENVDPL program would contribute to the modernization of the state institutions (CPS pillar III).</a><br />
