In the process of working towards this objective, the Project will also achieve two subsidiary objectives: (2) stabilization of degraded sandy agricultural lands through the planting of Robinia sp. and, conditions permitting, Quercus sp. anda number of minor species; and (3) ecological reconstruction of degraded lands in the lower Danube floodplain through planting of native broadleaf species, mostly Populus alba, Populus nigra and Salix sp.        The Project will also enable Romania to enter andbenefit from the carbon market. (4) Beyond the carbon sales proceeds from the Prototype Carbon Fund, the Project should be able to keep earning revenues from other carbon buyers. (5) More strategically, Romania will garner trading experience and relations for thefuture, in the fields of forestry, but also energy. Being able to harness the carbon market will catalyze public and private investment flows to Romania.       Furthermore, the Project contributes to (6) the transformation of the rural economy, from exploiting natural resources to acting as steward of natural resources.</a><br />

A well-functioning wholesale electricity market is an integral component of Romania's strategy to attract and sustain private sector participation in power sector renewal, especially for the refurbishment of power distribution and generation assets, and to develop a more efficient and increasingly competitive power sector.</a><br />

This objective would be achieved through: (i) professional development of teachers and principals of rural schools; (ii) improvement in learning conditions of rural schools both with respect to adequate minimum facilities and provision of basic teaching- learning materials; (iii) promotion of school- based innovation programs and community participation; and improvement of policy making capacity of local and central education authorities/agencies.</a><br />
