<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P152230" target=_blank>The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to assist Kazakhstan with developing a modern catastrophe insurance market infrastructure  that will support the launch of affordable, innovative catastrophe insurance products covering the risks of weather extremes.The proposed project activities support GEF’s focus on climate change and more specifically, GEF’s objectives on climate change adaptati on. By increasing access to sound catastrophe and weather risk insurance products for millions of people in Kazakhstan, SEECA CRIF i s also in line with the GEF strategy on adaptation. By supporting proper catastrophe risk management and risk transfer, SEECA CRIF r educes economic losses at both local and national levels from extreme weather related events, thereby reducing economic vulnerabilit y and contributing toward increased climate resilience at the national level. SEECA CRIF activities are also cross-cutting and col laborative, ensuring the engagement of major stakeholders in Kazakhstan, including the Ministry of Economic Development and Planning , the National Bank, and the Insurance Association. Moreover, because much of the technical work will be focused on establishing com plex catastrophe insurance infrastructure and systems, stakeholders will gain the requisite skills and knowledge to better understan d catastrophe risk and effectively adapt to such risks and climate change. Furthermore, public awareness of climate change and the b enefits of catastrophe and weather risk insurance will be raised through information campaigns and the public discussion of the new Law on Compulsory Catastrophe Insurance, resulting in increased demand for catastrophe and weather risk insurance products. The proj ect also aims to provide national and local governments as well as private individuals with the up-to-date actionable information on  the risk of natural disasters faced the communities and certain segments of national economy. The information will be delivered to the decision makers in the form of workshops, risk maps and through interactive education tools available on-line.Although the pro ject has been designed specifically for Kazakhstan, it can be easily replicated in other countries of the region that are adversely affected by climate change through the extension of insurance market infrastructure and insurance services to be developed for Kazak hstan to other markets of the region.</a><br />
