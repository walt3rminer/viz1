To achieve this objective, the project will (i) assist the various stakeholders of urban development in the preparation and implementation of tools and investments designed to increase access to services to as large a number of beneficiaries as possible; and (ii) support and facilitate the implementation of the public-private partnership in the provision of urban water services.</a><br />

The objectives and outcomes of the National Program are clearly articulated and have been quantified in the National Strategic Plan as follows: (i) reduce the number of new infections by encouraging and assisting 3 million people to get tested and to manage their status; (ii) achieve universal access to treatment and care for PLWAs including children by helping 300,000 PLWHA to access care and treatment and to benefit from psychosocial and economic support, mainly through associations of PLWHA; and (iii) reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS on 100,000 orphans and vulnerable children by assisting communities in identifying the most dramatic situations and accompanying them to access care and support. The overall goal of the proposed operation is to support the National Program.  It would do so through a set of specific activities, with earmarked funds to contribute to the National Program.  The Project Development Objectives would be to : (i) continue to strengthen the local response in order to reduce the number of new HIV infections and to coordinate the referral of seropositive cases of adults and children for effective treatment and follow up; and (ii) ensure transparent procurement procedures and fiduciary management of IDA funds, and effective programmatic monitoring and evaluation of results. Key performance indicators will be agreed upon with Government during project preparation and specify quantified baseline values and mid-term and end of project targets. They would contribute directly to the key indicators of the NAP. These indicators of the NP are consistent with the UNGASS indicators. Indicative performance indicators would include : number of local response subprojects awarded and successfully executed, correctly executed procurement actions, positive financial audits, and a functioning M&E system providing data for monitoring the local response on an ongoing basis and for taking stock at mid term and end of project.  A successful subproject at the local level would be able to report on results through its health center and local social services organizations. For example on reduction in HIV infection in newborns, annual increase in the number of new seropositive cases referred for treatment and followed up, annual increase in the number of orphans identified, referred for care and benefiting from support,  increased number of functioning associations for PLWHA and of solidarity networks created to support orphans. Lending instrument. The lending instrument proposed for the project is a Specific Investment Loan (SIL),  providing earmarked funds inside a coherent set of activities in the national Program and inside harmonized implementation arrangements in the National Program.. Potential Project components with indicative Costs. In line with the project development objectives presented earlier, the proposed project would have three components. -   Component 1 would finance local response subprojects in support of the National Program's three-pronged balanced strategy of prevention, access to treatment, and support and care for PLWHAs and OVC. About US$18 million would be allocated for local grants at the commune level and would be awarded on a competitive basis to initiatives contributing to the indicators of the national program.  The implementation manual would direct resources with an emphasis on girls, boys, women and specific high risks groups, identified by recent DHS and seroprevalence studies. Results of these studies were disaggregated by commune level and are already available in all 365 communes. The Implementation Manual would also strengthen the use of participatory M&E tools such as report cards, for example, already used in 6,000 communities. -   Component 2 would also be executed at the local co</a><br />
