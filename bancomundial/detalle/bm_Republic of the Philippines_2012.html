The CALA North South Expressway (NS Way) was identified as a potential candidate for Bank support due to its impact on improving road access to the country's premiere industrial belt by reducing traffic congestion along Aguinaldo Highway and Coastal Road, and for providing an alternative north-south artery to the CALA region. The NS Way project includes the construction of a six-lane 27.2 km expressway connecting Bacoor and Dasmarinas, and linking the Manila-Cavite Coastal Road (R-1 Expressway), in the north to the proposed East-West Cavite-Laguna Expressway, in the south. The objectives of the proposed World Bank-supported  NS-Way project would be: a) to improve road access to the country's premiere industrial belt by reducing traffic congestion through construction of the Cavite North-South Expressway (NS Way); and b) to assist in creating an enabling environment for private sector participation through a public-private partnership (PPP) scheme. The project would include a comprehensive assistance package that would combine investment lending for the construction of NS Way with credit enhancement and technical assistance to create an enabling environment for private sector participation in road infrastructure.</a><br />
