Specific objectives include:(a) Improving country statistical capacity in the compilation of detailed disaggregated nati onal accounts expenditure data, and addressing gaps identified in the 2011 ICP round. Efforts would focus specifically on improving difficult to measure areas, such as housing, financial services, net purchases abroad, services provided by non-profit institutions serving the households, etc.;(b) Improving the quality, comparability and consistency of consumer price data across beneficiary cou ntries, by advancing harmonization of CPI and ICP regional and sub-regional lists and survey activities;(c) Filling identified data  gaps in price statistics and national accounts, and introducing a new approach to allow the production of regular annual estimation  of PPPs for LAC countries; and (d) Promoting partnerships and strengthening the sense of ownership of the international comparison  between national statistical offices (NSOs) and regional and international agencies by sharing good practices and building human ca pital.</a><br />

Under this overarching objective, the project aims to enable countries to 1) conduct a population and housing census in the most efficient manner and in line with international standards, and 2) generate good quality nationally releva nt disaggregated data to ensure that no one is left behind with regard to formulation, implementation and monitoring of sustainable economic development policies and programs.</a><br />
