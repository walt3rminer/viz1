The project is supported by  the Prototype Carbon Funnd (PCF).  The Bank established PCF in July 1999, with the operational objective of mitigating climate change.  PCF supports projects  expected to generate  greenhouse gas emission reductions while complying with requirements of joint implementation(JI, Art.6.) and the clean development  mechanism (CDM,  Art. 12)  of Kyoto Protocol.  PCF purchases high quality greenhouse gas emission reductions, which could be registered with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for the purpose of the Kyoto Protocol.  By transacting the business of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the PCF is developing  a knowledge base of business processes and practices to facilitate climate-friendly investment and provide input for the ongoing UNFCCC  negotiations. In this particular case, the project will facilitate reduction of CO2 emissions through substituting energy from coal  with clean energy from biomass  made of rice husk produced by the Chinadega rice  and flour mill.  Th1.5MW Rice Husk-to-Power plant will produce 100% of the electrical power used at the  mill, and the electricity not consumed would be sold to local, recently privatized  distribution company. By using  rice husk, which for the most part would have been disposed in  open land fills,  the construction and operation of this electrical plant will also reduce  the release of Methane in the atmosphere, which results from the decomposition of husk left in open areas.</a><br />

This would be accomplished by (i) supporting the Government in the design and implementation of its national rural electrification strategy; (ii) implementing innovative public/private off-grid electricity delivery mechanisms in several pilot sites for later replication on a national scales; and (iii) demonstrating in the pilot areas the potential of targeted rural microfinance and business development servicces (BDS) to significantly enhance the development impact of rural electrification.</a><br />
