The public sector modernization efforts supported by the loan are expected to improve the efficiency of public expenditures and investment, strengthen the control of public finances, and enhance the effectiveness of government budgeting practices.  Given the potential for decreased fiscal revenues under the current global environment, these efforts are particularly important as a means to improve fiscal discipline and help foster growth in the medium term through a better allocation of scarce public resources.</a><br />
