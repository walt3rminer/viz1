It will also develop and implement tools required to measure and monitor greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions from the transport sector. While the operation of one single corridor does not result in large emission reductions, the project will help to develop the tools and procedures that may be applied, on a larger stage as a follow up to this operation. The availability of certified emission reductions is expected to accelerate this process.  Thus, the project will demonstrate that a high-quality bus corridor approach is a viable alternative for promoting a modal shift. In this context, the project will provide a valuable blueprint for other corridors in the city and elsewhere which could bring about a much higher overall impact.</a><br />
