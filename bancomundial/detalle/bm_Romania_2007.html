The PAL program reflects the Government's overarching objectives of establishing solid economic growth, reducing poverty and joining the European Union.  These objectives will be addressed by focusing on five key, cross-cutting themes: establishing public sector accountability; instilling financial discipline; instituting regulatory reforms; following good social and environment risk management practices; and ensuring property rights.  In addition, the PAL provides continuity with previous adjustment operations by ensuring sustained progress on the structural reforms begun under Private Sector Adjustment Loans 1 and 2, while at the same time introducing a new program of phased public sector and regulatory reforms that emphasizes institutional development and effective implementation.</a><br />
