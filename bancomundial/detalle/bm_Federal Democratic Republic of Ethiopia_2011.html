In line with the overall project development objective of the existing Private Sector Capacity Building Project (PS Dev CB Project - P050272), this Additional Financing would support private sector growth by creating conditions for improving its productivity and competitiveness. Specifically, additional resources would be directed towards component 3 of the ongoing operation: "strengthening the international competitiveness of the private sector and the capacities of its representative organizations." Through the use of matching grants instrument, the existing component limits access to firms that are only 100 percent export-oriented. The augmented resources would widen the scope by including domestically-oriented private sector firms to improve productivity and enhance competitiveness. In other words, a level playing field shall be provided for firms that are export- and domestically oriented. The domestic-oriented firms would have the potential to "graduate" and build their competitiveness in international markets once they break through the domestic markets.</a><br />
