The project will support participating countries in implementing two important international treaties: the Conservation on Biological Diversity and the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. This will be done through applied research using recent advances in genomic and geographic sciences and though the promotion of policies and capacity building for the implementation of integrated conservation of wild relatives of crops. This project is being dropped by the Sector Manager on behalf of the TTL, Nadim Khouri, who is no longer in the Region.</a><br />
