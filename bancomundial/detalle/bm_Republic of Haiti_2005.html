Key indicators for the project would be (i) total resources transferred to OCBs over the life of the project; (ii) change in access to basic services as a function of subprojects implemented by OCBs; (iii) cost-effectiveness of infrastructure investments, compared with traditional service delivery mechanisms, and (iv) cost-benefit of productive subprojects.</a><br />
