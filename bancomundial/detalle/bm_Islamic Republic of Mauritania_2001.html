Expected outcomes include: universal access to primary education, increased completion rates, expanded access to secondary education, and improved quality of education at all levels.  In order to achieve these objectives, the program will focus on four major areas, namely: (i) coverage: basic education access to all, particularly the disadvantaged, girls, and children in hard to reach communities; (ii) quality of teaching and learning in schools: basic physical infrastructure, adequately trained teachers, and adequate supply of essential didactic materials ; (iii) strengthening capacity for institutional and organizational change: development of leadership and management skills for the design and implementation of basic sector policies and strategies; and (iv) establishing an effective management system: pedagogic administrative and financial management, with clear management responsibilities and procedures.</a><br />
