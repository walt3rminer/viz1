The grant will contribute to economic recovery and growth by providing foreign exchange resources for imports of essential commodities, by providing financial resources to the Government budget to finance priority public expenditures and by supporting reforms to attract private investment.  By helping to close the financing gap in 2006, it will also contribute to maintaining macroeconomic stability and low inflation.</a><br />
