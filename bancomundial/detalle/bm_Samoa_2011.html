The strategy will define the strategic development thrusts and options for socio-economic and infrastructural development city-wide. Concurrently, this process will strengthen Samoa's urban management institutional framework so it can better create more inclusive, participative, productive, liveable and sustainable towns. It is expected that by taking such action the outputs will collectively make a positive contribution to the social, economic and environmental quality of life of urban dwellers; and, at a broader level, contribute to Samoa's achievement of the MDGs through 5 support components.</a><br />
