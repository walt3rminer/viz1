It is consistent with and supports the implementation of the Water Act (2002).  The project will support the operationalization and strengthening of new autonomous and ring-fenced service provision utilities- with clear roles , responsibilities and contractual arrangements. The key outcome will be an institutional framework that is capable of delivering safe, clean and affordable services to all strata of the Nairobi population in accordance with commercial and sustainable principles. Progress towards achieving the development objective will be monitored principally through the improvement in operating sustainability of the service delivery institutions throughout the project implementation period.</a><br />
