These objectives would be achieved by: (i) supporting the reform of the GOC.s labor regulations under Law 789 and improved training schemes; (ii) implementing Law 715 that amends the rules regarding the decentralization of education and health services while introducing incentives to enhance and measure quality; and (iii) developing an integrated and more efficient social protection system, including the establishment of institutions for regular impact evaluation and public oversight of social protection programs.</a><br />

In order to achieve this, the operation will support the modernization of bank, non-bank and securities market norms on capital adequacy and strengthen the ability of financial market participants to absorb market and credit risks, and macroeconomic shocks.  The operation will help implement alternatives for the provision of funding including the expansion of the housing finance market, through a diversified financial services industry which meets standardized and transparent reporting methods and harmonized asset valuation standards across sectors.  It will support the disclosure of  risks and volatility of managed investments  and credit portfolios, across the banking, mutual funds, insurance, and pension funds industries, applying uniform capital and provisioning standards for equivalent risks, thus engendering competition and rationalization in the system.</a><br />

Once in operation, the project is expected to displace an estimated1.87 million metric tons (Mmt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) up to 2012, and an estimated 4.56 Mmt CO2e up to 2019. It will also support an environmental and social program that will contribute to improvements in the welfare of the community in the area project, and the protection of the local environment.</a><br />
