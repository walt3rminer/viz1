The DPC will continue to support government efforts in the policy areas most affected by the economic downturn (i) the budget, in particular public investment planning, mining revenues management and ensuring adequate provisions for the maintenance of key infrastructure; ii) social protection, to assist with social welfare reform, and in particular the targeting of social transfers; (iii) the financial sector, to anticipate and prevent more bank failures, and to assist with the restructuring of the sector; and (iv) mining, to improve mining policies, in particular taxation and regulation. The proposed DPC is a single-tranche operation of US$20 million, because of the absence of a detailed medium-term policy framework with strong country ownership. It is expected that such a medium-term framework will be discussed and adopted by Parliament in 2010. Board Schedule Comments</a><br />

Mongolia Forest Landscapes Development and Conservation Project The Context Despite data deficiencies on forests and forestry-related issues, indications are that both are rapidly approaching a crisis situation for which the Government and communities seem largely unprepared. For example: In the northern coniferous forests "   both forest cover and forest quality is declining; "   the present estimated levels of forest harvesting are unsustainable; "   harvesting licenses are awarded annually rather than as long-term use rights, thus giving no incentive for sustainable management by communities or companies; "   between 36 and 80% of total harvest is illegal; GoM receives no royalties or taxes on this and it severely distorts domestic prices for both construction wood and fuelwood; "   fuelwood currently constitutes  between 65 and 80% of total wood harvest and is used by many poor rural and urban households for both cooking and residential heating; "   it is estimated that if current levels of forest depletion continue unabated and alternative sources of domestic fuel are not developed, serious fuelwood shortages will begin to be experienced in urban areas by the end of this decade. "   the forest area zoned for utilization is inadequate to support a viable domestic wood-based industry or to attract the investment capital it needs to modernize for greater efficiency; "   until now, instead of dealing constructively with the primary problem of unsustainable resource exploitation, GoM has tended to focus on peripheral issues, such as an forest inventory system, fire control, insect and disease control, and (largely unsuccessful) reforestation for which neither an ecological nor an economic rationale is apparent; and "   top-down enforcement of regulations has been ineffective. Southern saxaul forests "   saxaul, once commonly seen as belts of 10 m tall trees across a landscape of fragile soils, are now found primarily as fragments of shrubby growth interspersed with exposed, friable soils; "   saxaul's hard wood make it a hot and slow-burning fuel favored by people living in the Gobi; "   cutting for fuelwood and excessive grazing by goats and camels are reducing a valuable resource to the point of local extinction causing hardship to nomadic and settled people in the region; "   the degradation and loss of this forest landscape is a major factor causing the dust storms which originate in the Gobi desert and which each spring plague communities and cities in Mongolia, its neighbors and beyond. Thus Mongolia's forests are under severe threat and there are currently no mechanisms in place which would encourage communities or commercial timber companies to give attention to their sustainable management. If Mongolia is going to enjoy the economic and environmental benefits of their forests, and if communities in the forest landscapes are to engage in meaningful sustainable management, then action is required by both the government and donors. A two-pronged strategy involving gradual expansion of community forest management and strengthening of the existing Government enforcement regime seems to offer the best possibility to reduce illegal harvesting and other threats. Donor Interest The World Bank's Mongolian Forestry Sector Review (2003) recommended that the Government take action in six areas in order to resolve current difficulties before the forest resources of Mongolia are so severely degraded that options for future management are foregone: "   Community-based management of forest resources "   Market-based instruments to encourage more efficient use of wood resources and alternatives to wood consumption "   Sustainable forest management and enforcement of regulatory compliance "   Forest zoning "   Resource assessment and information management "</a><br />

A central emphasis of the project is to improve the reliability and financial sustainability of electricity distribution companies, so that consumers are provided reliable, high-quality distribution services by commercially-operated distribution utilities.</a><br />

This would be achieved through the piloting of index based livestock insurance in three provinces of Mongolia. Two products would be introduced in the pilot provinces: the Base Insurance Product; and the Disaster Response Product. The viability of both products would be tested during the project.</a><br />

Mongolia's boreal forest is the southern edge of the Siberian taiga, the largest continuous forest system in the world. It holds a relatively rich flora and fauna with species such as musk deer, sable, snow leopard, moose and brown bear found there. The area includes sites of extraordinary spiritual values and high biodiversity and several Special Protected Areas, including the newly-gazetted Onon-Balj National Park (NP), Khan-Khentie Strictly Protected Area (SPA), Gorkhi Terelj NP, Bogd Khan SPA and UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and Hustain Nuruu NP, provide habitat for species listed by IUCN as endangered, critically endangered and vulnerable. In the Management Effectiveness Assessment of the Mongolian PA system  recently undertaken by WWF Mongolia, pressures on the  two SPAs (Bogd Khan and Khan Khentie) proposed for this project, were rated as above average, and one of the proposed NPs (Gorkhi Terelj) had the third highest pressure rating of a total of 20 NPs. For biological importance, Khan Khentie, by far the largest of the proposed target areas, ranked among the top three SPAs nationwide. The municipal area of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city which holds nearly half of the country's population, includes protected forest and steppe regions which are threatened by uncontrolled development and natural resource extraction. Protection of this important biodiversity is currently inadequate. Throughout the country, protected area management plans insufficiently address financial sustainability and connectivity, and the lack of system-wide standards and training for protected area management staff further threaten the sustainability of the national PA system. Levels of education and awareness on the intrinsic values of the SPAs of the boreal forests - as well as on the role of the protected area system to conserve Mongolia's globally significant biodiversity - need improvement to leverage public support, stakeholder cooperation and compliance with protection policies. At present, planning procedures do not provide for integrated, landscape level management of the ecological network that will be necessary for long-term, effective biodiversity conservation. Demand for fuel and the need for household income generation continue to exert pressure on the forest resources, particularly near the capital city. The maintenance of ecosystem services is not encouraged by financial incentive mechanisms, and investments into alternatives to current livelihood strategies are lacking. This GEF project aims to strengthen financial sustainability and professional capacity for protected area management and biodiversity conservation in Mongolia, and the development of an approach to landscape-level planning that addresses the broad range of inter-connected pressures and threats to biodiversity and integrates planning strategies of municipalities, local governments and protected area administrations. The project will also support legal and regulatory innovations to broaden the scope of governance types of PAs. PA system-level activities will include piloting a model process of multi-stakeholder, multi-agency landscape level planning, incorporating biodiversity concerns into development planning; a review of capacity development needs for PA management, and development of professional standards and of comprehensive training for PA management on all levels; legal and regulatory innovations to broaden the scope of governance types of PAs; and an environmental awareness and education program (centered at Bogd Khan SPA) on the role and functioning of the PA system in Mongolia and its significance for conservation of heritage and ecosystem services, and for generating revenues. Site-level activities will focus on five globally-significant, high-priority biodiversity sites in strategically important locations f</a><br />
