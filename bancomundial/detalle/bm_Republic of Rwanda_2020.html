The selected economic sectors include Energy, Transport and Logistics, and Manufacturing (with a focus on ‘Made in Rwa nda’ products such as construction materials, light manufacturing and agro-processing). Building skills to advance the country’s e conomic agenda is a key priority of the GoR’s ongoing Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy-2 (EDPRS 2) launched in 20 13. EDPRS 2 builds on the country’s Vision 2020 which seeks to transform the country by raising its per capita GDP to middle-incomel evel by 2020. The Program is grounded in the Government of Rwanda’s (GoR) National Employment Programs (NEP) approved by Cabinet in 2014. NEP was designed to address the employment challenges in Rwanda and equip its population with the skills required to supportec onomic development. The main results areas of the operation are: (i) reinforcing governance of the skills development system; (ii)  ensuring provision of quality training programs with market relevance; (iii) expanding opportunities for continuous upgrading ofjob -relevant skills for sustained employability; and (iv) capacity building for implementation.  The Program will disburse against ac hievement of specific Disbursement Linked Results (DLRs) in these results areas</a><br />
