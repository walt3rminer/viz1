<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">10000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P082499" target=_blank>The development objective of the Conference of Ministers of Agriculture of West and Central Africa (CMA/WCA) Agricultural Trade Facilitation Project (ATFP) is to reduce institutional and policy constraints affecting agricultural trade by WCA member countries.  This would be achieved through the building of capacity to negotiate and implement international agricultural trade agreements at the regional and country levels, and the facilitation of regional agricultural trade. The proposed project would be part of World Bank Regional Integration Assistance Strategy (RIAS) for West and Central Africa. Overall regional integration in the region is being carried out by three main regional institutions; the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS); the Union Economique et Monétaire of West Africa (UEMOA); and the Communauté Economique et Monétaire de l.Afrique Centrale (CEMAC).  Stradling all member states of these organizations, CMA/WAC.s mandate is strengthen the existing regional capacity in agricultural policy analysis and (ii) improve policy formulation and implementation in their respective countries.  The proposed project to be executed by CMA/WAC would contribute to the region.s capacity to create an open regional market and meet the challenge of integrating global agricultural markets.  The project duration would be five years to allow CMA/WCA enough time to design and implement project activities in all member states of the CMA/WCA. The project would comprise three components: (i) Capacity Building in International Agricultural Trade Negotiation and Implementation (ii) Facilitation of Regional Agricultural Trade (iii) Project Support and Coordination A.  Capacity building in international agricultural trade negotiation and implementation A greater integration of WCA countries in world trade requires a more effective participation to international negotiations, an area where sub-regional intergovernmental organizations have also a role to play. The challenge for CMA/WCA countries is to negotiate a better access to markets in developed countries, to take advantage of more transparent world markets and to adjust to new world trade disciplines in view of creating a favorable environment for the transfer of technology and know-how and for investments.  A Technical Coordination and national liaison offices have been set up to help the CMA achieve its objectives in promoting intra regional trade, improving competitiveness of agriculture products and strengthening capacity in formulation of sound trade policy and strategies by WCA countries. This project component would assist CMA/WCA to (i) build agricultural trade advocacy skills of CMA member countries to be used in international and regional trade arenas , and (ii) establish public-private-sector partnerships at the regional and country levels to implement international trade agreements.   Through CMA/WCA General Coordinating Unit, the component will fund training seminars and workshops, support travel expenses of participants in trade negotiations, and contribute to the operation of International trade facilitation commissions where public and private sectors collaborate to implement agricultural trade agreements. B.  Facilitation of regional agricultural trade For CMA/WCA countries, improving regional agricultural trade is as important as improving access to international agricultural trade, as the two are complementary.  For CMA/ACA, one of the ways to assist member states facilitate regional trade is to provide to all members a transparent  picture of the implementation or lack thereof of enabling trade policies by member states.   This project component would support CMA/WCA to initiate and carried through two key activities: (i) a regional policy monitoring system to, in particular, develop an adequate reporting card system to be used to regularly monitor regional trading policies and regulations by member countries.  (ii) A regional trade information system to,</a><br />

The project will support HIV/AIDS-related health secto r human resource capacity building in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Tanzania using a #tra ining-of-trainers# (TOT) model. The project components include (a) health care p ractitioner training;  (b) monitoring, evaluation and knowledge-sharing;  and (c ) program coordination.  It is expected that, as a result of increased capacity among health care practitioners in the subregion, this project will contribute t o the enhanced delivery of HIV/AIDS-related services, stronger linkages between prevention and care interventions, and expanded South-South partnerships.</a><br />
