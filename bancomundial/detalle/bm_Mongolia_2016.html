<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P155305" target=_blank>The main objective of the proposed project is to strengthen MNAO&rsquo;s capacity, primarily in financial audit and audit firm contracting and oversight. To achieve this objective a comprehensive and systematic continuing professional development strategy together with a time-bound action plan that is needs-driven, tailored and sustainable will be developed and implemented. For this purpose, the current capacity strengths and gaps in financial audit and related areas will be independently assessed by a peer SAI. In parallel to this assessment, MNAO personnel will be surveyed and participate in focus groups to identify their requests for and perceptions of their professional development needs and alternative means to achieve these objectives. The results of the financial audit peer review and the knowledge and learning needs assessment to be carried out under this proposed project, as well as the 2010 performance audit peer review, will feed into development of a CPD strategy for the institution that will then be developed into a 3-year knowledgeand learning program. Furthermore, as part of the project, tailored training materials will be developed and actual training will be delivered to MNAO staff as per the CPD strategy and the knowledge and learning program. While the specific content and depth of topics to be covered under the CPD program are largely to be identified and tailored as per the assessments to be carried out,an early indication of capacity gaps reveals such areas as MNAO staff&rsquo;s knowledge and understanding of the relevant standards, i.e. IPSAS and the newly translated ISSAIs, quality control, contracting and quality assurance of private audit firm engagements, and audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Government.</a><br />
