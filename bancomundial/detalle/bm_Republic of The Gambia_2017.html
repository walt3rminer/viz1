The change of political leadership following the swearing-in of President Barrow constitutes an unprecedented opportunity for the people of Gambia, and for its policymakers to embark on a reform process to restore fiscal and external sustainability and lay the groundwork for a robust economic recovery. This first transfer of power through a democratic process since independence is predicted to yield noticeable political and economic dividends especially as diplomatic isolation has been lifted.  The new authorities face a number of challenges. In addition to the need to assure rapid reconciliation among political and ethnic groups, the new government must confront severe legacy economic problems â with a fiscal deficit for 2017 predicted to be 10%, 112% of debt to GDP, debt service absorbing half of all revenues, and less than one month of reserves â the economic situation is dire.  The ability of the new administration to deliver and show results is critical to ensuring a smooth transition and the World Bank can play a critical role.  The WBG engaged with the incoming authorities one week after the results of the elections. President-elect Barrow called for a close collaboration with donors, especially the WBG, and asked for the Bank assistance in shaping the economic recovery program of his administration. During a subsequent mission, the Minister of Finance confirmed the new governmentâs request for an emergency DPO that could both provide urgent relief, support critical fiscal consolidation, while protecting the poor and vulnerable and laying the groundwork for a robust economic recovery.   The overall objective of the emergency Development Policy Financing is to support a return to macroeconomic stability, boost economic recovery and mitigate social impacts of the crisis.  The Bank is working in close collaboration with the IMF and other partners. Board Schedule Comments</a><br />
