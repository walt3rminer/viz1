The objective of the proposed Program is to increase the availability of ICT services and enable the more widespread application of ICT services supporting improvements in econo mic and social development in the Marshall Islands.   This Second ICT Sector DPO will support the following which have been establishe d as the triggers for this operation:  1. Sector policy adopted setting out the Government’s vision for the ICT sector and providing a roadmap for (a) implementing a new legal framework, and (b) intr oducing competition. 2. New legal and regulatory framework enacted (a) encouraging private-sector led  investment, including mandatory (cost-based) passive infrastructure sharing; an d (b) prescribing a modern licensing framework permitting the introduction of co mpetition.   3. Independent ICT sector regulator established with authority to regulate multi ple operators.  Spectrum management plan, numbering plan, interconnection regime , and dispute and mediation procedures adopted. 4. Specific blocks of spectrum in designated bands sufficient for new licensees to offer mobile wireless services designated in the national frequency allocatio ns table. Government approves a financial, ownership, and operational restructuring plan f or NTA.  Any remaining exclusive rights in connection with the supply of ICT inf rastructure or services in the Marshall Islands are terminated subject only to t he power of the regulator to issue licenses.   5. The submarine cable, the associated landing station and international gateway , and the debt owing to RUS in connection with the construction of the submarine  cable are separated from the vehicle carrying out the retail operations previou sly conducted by NTA and vested in a Government-owned entity.  Should this form of separation not be feasible, the new Communications Law will empower the regul ator to enforce open access to international connectivity at cost-based prices.
