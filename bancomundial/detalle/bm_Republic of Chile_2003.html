To help reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) from ground transport in Santiago through the promotion of a long-term modal shift to more efficient and less polluting forms of transport, and the adoption of sustainable low-GHG transport measures. To that end, the project will support the implementation of the 2000-2010 Urban Transport Plan for Santiago (TRANSANTIAGO, formerly known as PTUS), a comprehensive multi-sector plan, which is consistent with the overall objectives of the GEF operational program on sustainable transport.  The plan specific objectives are to (i) maintain share of public transport (60% of total trips); (ii) promote rational management of transport demand, internalizing all costs from car travel; (iii) promote land-use policies that take into account environmental and transport dimensions helping reduce the average trip length;  (iv) promote better coordination between agencies dealing with transport related policies and issues; and (v) reduce emissions of air pollutants from public transport (70% of PM10 and 45% of NOx emissions from 1997 levels). 1.2.,,To help improve air quality of Santiago, through reducing emissions of air pollutants like SOx, CO, PM, and NOx (which together with VOCs contribute to the formation of smog or tropospheric ozone (O3)).</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">25260000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P077282" target=_blank>The project seeks two development objectives, which, in agreement with the Government's strategy, are expected to place Chile on the path to a knowledge-based economy:  First, and foremost, the project will support the development of an effective innovation system. It will do so by establishing a strong and coherent policy framework, promoting high-quality and relevant science and technology activities and by supporting key interfaces in the innovation system, especially between the public and private sector as well as international linkages. Second, and subordinate to the first goal, the project will improve the stock of human capital in the Chilean science and technology sector, a development objective which is highly complementary to the establishment of an effective innovation system and per se a critical precondition for establishing a competitive knowledge-based economy. The project development objectives will be pursued through the implementation of three components: (i) Improving Chile's Science, Technology and Innovation System; (ii) Strengthening Chile's Science Base, and (iii) Enhancing Public-Private Linkages.</a><br />
