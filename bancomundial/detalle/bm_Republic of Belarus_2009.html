The Government#s reform program aims to mitigate the impact of the crisis and post-crisis restructuring on vulnerable groups by strengthening social safety nets with a particular emphasis on scaling up better-targeted social assistance programs.  The program also encourages resource reallocation in the economy by reducing the cost of entry (through lower regulatory, operating, and administrative barriers and costs). With the increased scarcity of fiscal resources, the Government has hardened budget constraints on the enterprise sector, directing fewer resources towards less competitive sectors of the economy.</a><br />
