Could they be used more effectively to enhance adaptation strategies? - What management regimes for forests can realize the potential of forests to enhance resilience? The management regimes could include a range of activities including restoration of degraded lands, reforestation/afforestation, protection, etc. - What are the policy measures and associated institutional arrangements that would facilitate the use of forests for climate change resilience?</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P120368" target=_blank>The proposed project will build on a range of ongoing stakeholder initiatives and best practices in global partnerships in the fisheries and other natural resources sectors to engage the fishing industry in an Alliance for Sustainable Fisheries with particular emphasis on developing countries and sustainable value chains for food fish products. The Alliance (ALLFISH) has already been established and is in its startup phase. The International Coalition of Fisheries Associations (ICFA) has been selected as the Secretariat and recipient of a $1 million DGF grant.  ICFA is a coalition of the national fish and seafood industry trade associations from the world's major fishing nations representing countries producing over 70% of the world's fish. ICFA also offers linkages to major seafood buyers including supermarket chains. ALLFISH will extend the ICFA network to developing countries, develop and promote codes of industry conduct with developing country stakeholders and foster sustainable 'south-north' seafood value chains and equitable trade.</a><br />

The aim is to bring together policy makers and practitioners from 2 disaster-prone regions (South Asia and Central America) and 3 countries (India, Guatemala, and Honduras) with large sections of vulnerable communities with the objective of experience sharing and information exchange on community led DRR practices with community based women groups and local government (CBWG&LG) to integrate DRR perspectives into mainstream disaster risk management (DRM).This goal will be achieved through two interlinked objectives: Objective 1: Positioning Grassroots Women's Groups as builders of Community Resilience Helping them to engage in effective partnerships with local governments and national governments to innovate and scale up locally led DRR initiatives. This in turn will drive the demand for development and poverty reduction programming that places disaster risk and vulnerability reduction at the center of development plans and programs at local, national and regional levels. Objective 2: Local implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) Implementation will be ensured by fostering collaborative local partnerships that practically reduce the vulnerability of poor families to the devastating impacts of disaster and climate change in high risk areas.</a><br />
