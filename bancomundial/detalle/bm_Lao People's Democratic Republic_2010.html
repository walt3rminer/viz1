The main objective of this project would be to support community-led recovery of damaged local infrastructures, with a focus on PRF finance infrastructure, in these two districts. Additionally, a portion of these resources would be utilized to provide technical assistance to the PRF to strengthen its overall Disaster Risk Management and Response capabilities and to ensure disaster-resistant technology is integrated into standard infrastructure design and delivery. Main activities include: - Rehabilitation of about 12 PRF and Government-funded community subprojects (focusing on water supplies, dispensaries, access roads, irrigation systems and bridges) - Identify more resilient technologies to apply to relevant PRF-financed infrastructures - Capacity building of PRF staff and other relevant government staff - Development of a PRF disaster risk reduction and response strategy By supporting the rehabilitation of Ketsana destroyed infrastructure in two of the Government's Priority Poverty Districts, the proposed activity is expected to contribute to reducing poverty and increasing well-being in Ketsana impacted villages in Saravanh province.  As well, by building capacity of PRF and other counterpart staff, identifying resilient technologies, and developing a PRF disaster risk reduction and response strategy, the project is also expected to contribute to improving the Government's capacity to respond to future natural disasters (mainly risks of floods and drought) in Lao PDR.</a><br />
