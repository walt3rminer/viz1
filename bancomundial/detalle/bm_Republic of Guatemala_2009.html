To this end, the proposed Project would:    (i) improve the effectiveness of the conditional cash transfer program to boost demand for education, health and nutrition services in 130 municipalities;  (ii) increase access to a basic package of health and nutrition services for underserved population in the 70 most vulnerable municipalities;   (iii) improve physical access to social service providers in the 46 most vulnerable municipalities; and  (iv) enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Finance to facilitate coordination of multi-sector programs and to inform policy making.</a><br />

(Baseline:11.3 percent in 2008) # Results indicators have been developed for fifty percent of Central Government#s expenditures in order to introduce the results informed budget framework. (Baseline: 22 percent in 2008) (ii) Expanding opportunities for vulnerable groups through improved and transparent targeting of social programs # Co-responsibilities verified for 50 percent of the Conditional Cash Transfer Program beneficiaries, half of which are extreme poor, based on a framework for monitoring and evaluation.

The overall objective of the project is to assist Guatemala put in place measures in the energy sector that will allow it to reduce its dependence on imported oil. The project would employ both short- and longer-term options involving both investment and technical assistance.  Among the short-term options are: (i) increased regional trade, (ii) power system management improvements to reduce losses, (iii) operation and maintenance measures to increase load factors, and (iv) demand-side management (energy efficiency) measures for residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural sectors.  Among the longer-term options are: (i) repowering of existing power capacity, such as hydropower rehabilitation and high-efficiency bagasse cogeneration, (ii) transmission investments, both domestic and regional, and (iii) investment in new generation capacity, including coal, hydro, LNG, geothermal and other renewables.  Technical assistance will also be included, such as: (i) power system planning to promote least-cost investments, including capital-intensive, (ii) policy measures to enhance the use of domestic and renewable energy resources, and (iii) regulatory measures to attract private sector investment within the context of a national plan.</a><br />
