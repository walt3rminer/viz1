This credit completes the series of annual programmatic development policy credits (DPC) in support of PESRP.  The Bank has been requested to support the continuing reform program through a second series of annual DPCs.  Preparation of the fourth credit is underway under the second  DPC series.   Key pillars of the PESRP supported by this first DPC serie are:  (A) public finance reforms to increase public spending for education (and other pro-poor services) and to ensure fiscal sustainability; (B) reforms that strengthen devolution and improve the fiduciary environment and governance; and (C) education sector reforms to improve quality, access, and sector governance.  There has been steady progress in the Program supported by PEDPC III.  The Program is showing improvements in public sector enrolment and in reducing the gender gap at the primary and middle school levels.  The  third credit has assisted the Government in completing the agreed reform framework.</a><br />
