Hungary.s electricity demand approximately equals domestic generation, with export and import playing marginal roles only. Total installed capacity is 7.85 GW, of which 5.96 GW is conventional thermal, 1.84 GW is nuclear and 0.05 GW is large hydro-generation. In 1999 total generation was 34.9 TWh, of which conventional thermal was 21.3 TWh, nuclear 13.4 TWh and large hydro 0.2 TWh. Existing small hydro- plants account for less than half a percent of the total generation. Total small hydro rehabilitation potential in Hungary is estimated to be 50 MW at 40 sites with estimated annual production of 200 GWh. These plants are owned by regional water authorities, one regional electricity distribution company (ÉMÁSZ), private investors and the State</a><br />
