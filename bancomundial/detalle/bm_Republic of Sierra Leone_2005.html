Medium-term Objectives, ERRC III and Prior Actions for ERRG IV  58. This grant is brought to the Board of Executive Directors for approval upon the strength of the Government?s commitment to its program of reform and poverty reduction.  This commitment is demonstrated not only through the completion of all ERRC III conditions but also by the completion of a number of prior actions that build upon the Government achievements under ERRC III. These are documented below, arranged by PRSP/CAS pillars.  Additional action, building on these achievements is discussed in the next sub-section (V.B.2.). Objective 1:  Good governance. 59. Government Budgeting and Accountability Act.  Several damaging amendments were made in 1996 to the Public Budgeting and Accounting Act of 1992.  These amendments had the effect of reducing the oversight roles of both the Office of the Auditor-General and the Parliament.  The amendments also distorted the relationship between the Accountant-General?s Department (AGD) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF).  The 2002 limited scope CFAA made the correction of these amendments a priority and work began under ERRC III.  The new Government Budgeting and Accountability law corrects the 1996 amendments and more.  It is the keystone of reform in public resource management.  It clarifies roles and responsibilities, sets out rules for the use of public funds, sets requirements for accounting and auditing and the management of Government stores.  Enactment of the new law by Parliament is a prior action for ERRG IV that was completed on February 4, 2005.    60. Supporting decentralization.  Government believes that a contributing factor to the ten-year civil war was the antagonism between a large section of the rural population, who were marginalized from the political process and deprived of social services and economic development opportunities, and those who had access and control in Freetown.  Household survey data for 2003/04 are clear that the problem persists with large inequalities between urban Freetown and the rest of the country.   61. In this light, it is Government?s intention to restore local governance and decentralize the provision of services.  Government took the first steps in 2004 with the passage of the Local Government Act that created new local councils and mandated regular elections at the local level.   The first local elections in more than 30 years were successfully completed in May 2004.  The next step is to establish local council budgets for 2005 and begin the delivery of decentralized services.  62. The Budget Speech for the 2005 budget, read before Parliament in December 2004, did not include details of the transfer formulas to be used for the allocation of transfers to the newly created local governments, nor the specific transfers to each local government.  This is because a formal decision had not been taken to authorize the use of proposed formulas.  This, in turn, is because the Local Government Finance Committee had not yet been made operational with the appointment of its committee members. As part of the agreed Program, and as a prior action, Government had corrected this by appointing six of seven required committee members to the Local Government Finance Committee by the end of March 2005.  The adoption and promulgation of the local government transfer formulas appears in section V.B.2 below as a trigger. 63. The IRCB project, in collaboration with the AfDB, DfID and EC, lays out a detailed medium-term plan of next steps for Local Government capacity building and public financial management and sets standards which must be met for access to resources. Progress in these next steps is included as part of the ERRG IV program.    64. Procurement reform.  There is a widespread perception in Sierra Leone that very few public procurement contracts in recent years had been tendered through transparent and competitive processes.  Empirical data support this:  between April 2003</a><br />
