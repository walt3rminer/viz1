Building on the CDD approach which has proven successful under the first phase of the Sergipe Rural Poverty, the new project would improve on this experience by:  (i) strengthening the cross-sectoral integration of investments in rural areas, (ii) providing greater emphasis on education, health, culture, natural resources management and environmental sustainability; and (iii) scaling up impact by using the skills, social capital and experience of the Municipal Councils and community associations to improve the relevance, efficiency, sustainability, targeting and outcomes of non-project activities in rural Sergipe.</a><br />

Mostly by focusing on institutional strengthening and rehabilitation of key bulk water infrastructure, the proposed project will seek to consolidate this system, which the state has often overlooked in the past in favor of larger infrastructure investments. The specific project development objective is to implement an integrated water resources management system that will support more environmentally sustainable use of water resources while also increasing access of poor families to reliable potable water and decreasing operational and maintenance costs of water allocation and distribution systems.</a><br />

However this project only claims emission reduction credits from the avoidance of methane emissions from wood waste piles, and not from electricity generation through biomass.</a><br />
