The Enterprise Incubator (EI) project is an entry point to start unlocking these rigidities in the IT cluster - a tiny, yet very dynamic pocket of vitality in an otherwise stagnant economy. The project will pilot innovative private-public mechanisms for providing business development services to nascent enterprises and continuous education and training to IT professionals. The project is expected to have a powerful demonstration effect, triggering reforms in other sectors of the economy.  The project has three objectives: (i)  Employment creation/productivity. To provide a demonstration effect of company formation in an inhospitable business environment . This will be implemented and monitored among the beneficiary population of start-up firms (around 50 enterprises). (ii)  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). To provide a demonstration effect of the positive impact of FDI in IT industry. (iii)  Continuous skill upgrading.  To pilot demand-driven mechanisms of continuous upgrading of IT skills of professionals, third year students, and work force and enterprise managers and employees.</a><br />
