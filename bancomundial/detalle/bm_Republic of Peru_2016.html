To achieve this objective the PIP is expected to generate two types of co-benefits: (i) reduce poverty of indigenous communities and other local populations, under a gender equality approach, by increasing income form management of sustainable forest landscapes and productive agroforestry mosaics; and (ii) reduce the loss of biodiversity and maintenance of forest ecosystem services. The Project Development Objective is to improve the capacity of forest communities and government agencies to manage forest resources sustainably, strengthen forest tenure rights and enhance forest governance leading to reduce GHG emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in the Atalaya Province.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">1250000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P156858" target=_blank>Project Development Objective (Note: will be disclosed in the MOS) The proposed Boosting Productivity for Growth Development PolicyFinancing with a Deferred Drawdown Option (DPF-DDO) aims to support Peru’s efforts to foster productivity growth under a more challenging external environment. Lower export demand, including from China, worsening terms of trade, and the prospects of higher borrowing costs is affecting a large number of emerging economies. In this context, a larger portion of economic growth in Peru will have to come from further increasing productivity. The proposed DPF-DDO supports measures targeting key productivity constraints by enhancing the quality of human capital and fostering competition pressures and trade to boost firms’ productivity.
