The project will result in GHG emission reductions from the energy saved through the use of energy efficient equipments.The GEF energy efficiency project will be operationally blended with electricity sector investments under the IDA financed Multisectoral Water and Electricity Infrastructure Project (MSWEIP). The MSWEIP was approvedby the World Bank Board of Directors on May 13, 2008, and is currently been implemented by the energy and water utility REGIDESO.The project development objective of the MSWEIP is to: (i) increase access to water supply services in peri-urban areas of Bujumbura; (ii) increase reliability and quality of electricity services; (iii) increase water supply quality and reliability in Bujumbura; and (iv) strengthen REGIDESO’s financial sustainability. The MSWEIP is helping REGIDESO to restore its financial and commercial viabilityand the quality and continuity of services in the face of the increasing demand from individual consumers and economic agents. The MSWEIP has been designed to provide a balance between immediate needs and medium- to long-term planning. It addresses to the urgent need to fill the current gaps between supply and demand in both electricity and water supply. At the same time, the project supports long term planning activities and studies, as well as the strengthening of the operational capacity of the main sector institutions in order to avoid or effectively reduce future gaps.</a><br />
