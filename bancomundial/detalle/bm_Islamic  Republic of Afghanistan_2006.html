The key performance indicators and corresponding end-of-project targets are limited to the Project Area. Given the paucity of baseli ne data, the proposed targets should be seen as approximate. What is needed is clear progress along these parameters. 1. The contraceptive prevalence rate would have increased by ten percent (10%) among women using modern family planning methods. 2. The cure rate among detected tuberculosis cases would have increased to eighty percent (80%). 3. The proportion of children aged six (6) months to fifty-nine (59) months that have received vitamin A supplement woud have increa sed to ninety percent (90%). 4. Fully-Immunize-Child vaccine coverage among children aged twelve (12) months to twenty-three (23) months would have increased by  thirty-five percent (35%).</a><br />
