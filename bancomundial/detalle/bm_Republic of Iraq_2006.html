These key functions will enable MOEn to undertake environmental policy analysis and coordination, formulate laws and regulations, monitor environmental quality, promote environmental awareness and conduct technical studies.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">40000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P099059" target=_blank>The objective of the proposed project is to: (i) help alleviate the current power supply shortfall in the Kurdish region through urgent repair work; (ii) strengthen the capacity of local operational staff; and (iii) prepare for the subsequent rehabilitation of the Dokan and Derbandikhan hydropower plants.  The reliability of both power plants is very low and the effective capacity of each has been as low as 50 percent.  Subsequent rehabilitation would restore their original capacity of 400 and 249MW respectively.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P098979" target=_blank>The objective of the proposed project is to strengthen the ability of the GOI to make informed decisions towards reducing poverty, creating jobs and protecting the vulnerable.  Specifically, the project would focus on strengthening the ability of Iraqi officials to:  # collect and analyze data on poverty and unemployment;  # develop information-based strategies to reduce poverty, generate employment, and improve the functioning of social safety nets; and  # assess the effect of economic policy options on both poverty and employment, including the impact of sequencing reforms and policies.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P099295" target=_blank>The overall objective of the project is to strengthen the policy, management and administrative capacity in MOLSA and MOF to develop, manage and monitor pension and social safety net reforms. Since this is a small Technical Assistance project, which will be implemented over a short period of time, it will be difficult to measure final outcomes. One intermediate measure of success will be that both MOLSA and MOF are able to use information generated by the new systems for social safety net and pension decision making.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P092481" target=_blank>The project will consist of two components: (a) technical assistance for capacity building of the new Ministry of Environment of Iraq; and (b) the design and implementation of demonstration environmental improvement projects. Note:  Due to a change in funding availability, the scope of this project had to be reduced from its initial US$25 million to US$5 million.  The new project, coded under P099809, is limited to component (a) above, i.e., technical assistance to the Ministry of Environment.  In addition, task team leadership will be changed from Mr. Hocine Chalal to Ms. Maria Sarraf, effective immediately. CFAllan--January 25, 2006.</a><br />
