PCN review Decision Note and finalized PCN was circulated on Dec 28.  Appraisal is indicatively planned for late April (though this may slip). Board is planned for late July 2010 (though this may also slip). As well as supporting the institutional set up of the FDE, the proposed project, through a combination of IBRD lines of credit ($100m) and CTF loans ($150m), will expand the FDE#s capability to offer long-term debt financing to public and private sector projects. It will (i) allow the FDE to provide long-term debt financing support to sub projects through direct lending by FDE to infrastructure projects (possibly by joining a consortium of banks) and (ii) deliver Clean Technology Funds to the FDE for disbursement to sub-projects that meet CTF criteria. Overall, the project will complement funding already available to the FDE # but which has mainly been earmarked for use as equity financing. Broadening the mix of sources of funds available to the FDE (i.e. IBRD and CTF) will allow the FDE to better tailor financing packages to the particular needs of less financially viable sub-projects to allow them to reach financial closure. 5/28/10.
