The CAS envisages that over the three-year period of CAS implementation, there could be two adjustment credits to support its implementation in the base-case lending scenario.  This credit assists Zambia to:      Return to a macroeconomic framework conducive to robust growth;     Strengthen the role of the financial sector;     Strengthen the credibility and institutional capacity of the public sector;     Improve Zambia?s business environment.  IDA and the Government of the Republic of Zambia agree that achieving these objectives in part depends on the implementation of specific reforms in the areas of:  (i) pensions and payment culture among Government agencies;  (ii) state owned non-bank financial institutions;  (iii) public expenditure management, debt management, and civil service reform; and (iv) private sector development including regulation of public utilities and private business  First and foremost, the main objective of the EMGCredit is to support the policy and institutional change agenda outlined in the CAS. Therefore, the intermediate indicators report on progress towards CAS outcomes.</a><br />
