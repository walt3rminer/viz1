The key beneficiaries are the Public Interest Entities including State-Owned Enterprises, the Chamber of Accounts (the country's supreme audit institution), the Chamber of Auditors (in its role as the country's auditing services regulator and standard-setter, subject to whatever rebalancing of responsibilities between the Ministry of Finance and the Chamber of Auditors may take place as part of the enhancements introduced when improving the statutory framework), the Ministry of Finance, and accounting and auditing professionals and stakeholders in Azerbaijan.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">450000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P083108" target=_blank>The main project objective is to improve railway services in Azerbaijan, as well as the competitiveness, financial sustainability, operating and cost efficiency, and capacity of the Azerbaijan Railways (ADDY) in particular along the transport corridor toward Georgia (east-west corridor).   The project will support the implementation of the first phase of the Government Program covering components, which are most time-sensitive and will most rapidly lead to cash flow generation.  The project will focus on: (i) maintaining and growing the railway business (increase revenue from US$219 million today to about US$283 million by 2015) by providing the profitable freight market segment with proper service, infrastructure and locomotive capacity; (ii) transforming the Azeri Railways into a financially self-sustainable operation in freight transportation, covering all its costs (including infrastructure maintenance and traction) from revenues, while improving its operational efficiency; and (iii) improving the transparency of the Railway sector by introducing International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and profit centers  (passenger/freight) and by separating on an accounting basis passenger service that could be self-sustained from others.   Other parts of the Government Program are expected to be covered through separate projects once the proper financial and technical due diligence has been completed.</a><br />
