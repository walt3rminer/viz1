The global project objective is sustainable POPs stockpiles management and strengthening of the regulatory and institutional arrangements for long term control of POPs and other toxic substances in line with the requirements of the Stockholm Convention and other related conventions and protocols ratified by Moldova.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P084688" target=_blank>A study on the Potential Use of Renewable Energy (Biomass) in Moldova, financed under the Austrian Global Environment Consultant Trust Fund, was completed in September 2002. This study clearly identified primary and unprocessed agricultural wastes, especially wheat straw, as the most available and unused biomass suited for thermal energy production in Moldova. Subsequent research and investigation has refined an approach toward introducing biomass as a thermal energy source. This investigation determined that small scale systems (500 - 1000KWth) in rural communities were suited for initial introduction into Moldova. Successful uptake of small and medium sized systems will lead to the consequential use of larger district heating systems. The proposed project would provide a foundation for a broader and more efficient use of biomass, especially in rural communities, as a substitute for coal, oil, gas and corded wood. The project will act as a catalyst for the introduction and promotion of the use of biomass, principally for heat through the efficient use of primary agricultural wastes. This will (i) reduce greenhouse emissions by reducing environmental pollution from unwanted biomasses otherwise being burnt in the field; (ii) improve energy efficiency in heating systems from renewable energy sources; (iii) introduce renewable energy by substituting carbon neutral biomass for hydro-carbons (coal, heavy oil and gas); and (iv) Recycle ash residues as a fertilizer, primary objectives for funding under the Renewable Energy Operational Program of the GEF. Main Objective of the Project is: to overcome barriers to the update of biomass technology by providing examples of best practice (demonstration plants) in the use of biomass fuelled energy systems as a viable alternative to gas, oil and coal and as a sustainable means of addressing the energy supply problems facing rural communities and agro-enterprises. Demonstration systems would be of a size, scale and cost appropriate for wide replication in rural areas. This would be supported by access to information, technical support and a fund to cover the incremental capital cost as compared to gas fuelled systems. The Project will have two main components (i) establishment of a financial intermediation mechanism to finance the incremental gap between the capital cost of biomass and conventional energy systems, during the first extension phase; and (ii) demonstration sites to show the efficiency and operational characteristics of biomass fuelled energy systems: Component 1: Financial intermediation (GEF $0.85m). The establishment of the proposed three demonstration units by grant finance; a lease financing procedure, based on a revolving fund, connected with the 2KR assistance program would be extended to the various components of this program:- development of the biomass market through the supply of equipment required for the collection, storage and handling of baled straw biomass; marketing of biomass energy supply systems through lease funding biomass systems (where the higher capital costs would be off set by the lower annual fuel costs). Component 2: Technical assistance (GEF $0.15). Mechanisms to support capacity building for energy audits and process designs within Moldova. Tender specifications for demonstration units (services, biomass and equipment). Lease purchase procedures to facilitate marketing. Development of the technology transfer, information and training unit.</a><br />
