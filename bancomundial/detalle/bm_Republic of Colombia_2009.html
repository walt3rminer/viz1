The project assumes that building assets is a measure that contributes to mitigate the risk of displacement, and that restoring a basic safety net to displaced families is a first step in their social and economic stabilization.  However, the project does not address directly the problem of conflict and violence but supports people to reduce and mitigate the risk of conflict and violence.</a><br />

The specific objectives are to: (i) implement high quality Bus Rapid Transit Systems (BRTs) in selected cities; (ii) improve accessibility to the poor through fare integration  and; (iii) build greater institutional capacity at the national level to formulate urban transport policies and strategies (regulatory, operational, economic, environmental and social aspects), and at the local level for urban transport planning and traffic management.</a><br />
