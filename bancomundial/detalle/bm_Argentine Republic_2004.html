An active collection system will be installed at the landfill that will consist of gas extraction wells, collection piping, mechanical blowers, LFG condensate and flare systems, as well as a monitoring and control system. The resulting reductions in LFG emissions will be monitored, verified, certified, and sold as ERs to the CDCF administered by the World Bank. Part of the income from the sales of ERs will be used by the Municipality of   Olavarría to install a safe and reliable distribution system for potable water in the rural village of Espigas, 80 km from Olavarría, as well as solar water heating systems in two local schools.</a><br />
