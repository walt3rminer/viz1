Secondly, the project aims to support the preparation of City Infrastructural Investment Programmes for the National Capital District and Goroka City, which will also support pre-feasibility studies for priority investment projects identified in prior UN-Habitat support to the cities through the Office of Urbanization. Activities conducted in these areas would serve as the foundations for subsequent efforts to up-scale the lessons learned city-wide and nationally to other cities.  These activities will also contribute to mainstream efforts related to slum upgrading approaches in the National Urban Plan and its legislative reforms. It is expected that the implementation of this project will also strengthen the institutional capacities of the Office of Urbanization, the National Capital District Commission and those of Goroka City to better perform their responsibilities in urban development.</a><br />
