<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">20000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P110327" target=_blank>The objective of the proposed project is to increase sustainable access to water services in Conakry through: (i) financing physical investments in the water supply system; and (ii) improving the commercial and financial performance of the urban water utility, especially by addressing sector reform, governance and accountability issues within the utility.  The objective will be achieved through investing selectively in the rehabilitation of certain high return segments of the distribution network, based on the performance of a system flow analysis.  Governance issues and poor accountability are at the heart of the poor performance of the urban water sector and the urban water utility.  They will be tackled based on the conclusions of: (i) an ongoing institutional,management and operational performance audit of SEG under AFD support; (ii) the likely outsourcing of the commercial and/or financial functions critical to achieve quick results; (iii) increased cost recovery in order to achieve the financial sustainability; and (iv) the strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory capacity in the urban water sector.  It is also recommended to review the possibility of installing an incentive based performance contract. Water tariffs and long term cost recovery issues will also be addressed during the project, through the development and implementation of a sound tariff policy. The accountability and autonomy of SEG are of prime importance to achieve the above objective The proposed project will also directly contribute to the MDGs: especially MDG7 (“halving by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water”) as it is estimated that approximately 610,000 urban residents will gain access to safe water thanks to the Project , but also to: MDG1 (quality of life), MDG3 (promote gender equality and empowering women), MDG4 (reduce child mortality), MDG5 (improve maternal health), and MDG6 (Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases).</a><br />
