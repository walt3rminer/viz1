The produced electricity will be fed into the municipal grid and replace electricity that the municipal electric company is currently buying from other suppliers. The project will be implemented on the Mariannhill and (originally projected) at the La Mercy landfill sites.The Mariannhill landfill is an active landfill site where waste will be deposited until 2024. It extends over 49 ha and receives 550 to 700 tonnes of waste per day. The Mariannhilllandfill was officially designated a Nature Conservancy site in late 2002. It is the only landfill in South Africa granted such a status.The second landfill site, La Mercy, is an old landfill, which is now closed and is not generating Emission Reductions.</a><br />
