The overall outcome of the project will beaccess to improved transport infrastructure, more efficient and fluid logistic chains leading to increased trade potential at reduced transaction cost. The "Corridor" approach is expected to have a catalytic effect in the region, contributing to building and consolidating a strong and sustainable regional trade partnership.</a><br />

The objective of the facility is to improve food security in Arab countries. In order to achieve this higher-level objective each individual project will have one of three objectives: (1) Improving the poverty targeting of safety nets; (2) improving agricultural and water productivity; and (3) managing exposure to international food commodity market volatility. The project development objective will be specifically tailored to the needs of each project. The facility was designed as a program similar to the GFRP and the GAFSP by tailored to the unique food security constraints faced by MENA. The framework document was successfully reviewed at the QER stage and endorsed in October 2011. Guidance received from OPCS was to proceed but change the coding to GPP similar to the GFRP.</a><br />
