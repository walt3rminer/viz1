Specifically, the project will contribute to the achievement of national trade facilitation and economic development objectives through:  the preparation of better-designed and targeted capacity building programmes focused on improving Customs efficiency and effectiveness; better coordination and deployment of international assistance; the acquisition of customs technical and operational skills; improved compliance to international standards; and the empowerment of administrations to manage and sustain their improvements and to cope with further change in a dynamic and sustainable way.</a><br />

For this, the specific objectives of the project are: to develop a TRS model which is based upon the WCO TRS model with the required modifications to meet  the COMESA Members' needs and requirements; to build capacity in designing and implementing the national TRS process and analyzing the TRS results.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">6500000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P122040" target=_blank>The objective is to support economic growth in southern Africa by facilitating the movement of goods and people and fostering regional integration among the countries served by the corridor.  The proposed SATTF project is conceived as a multi-country, multi-sector, and multi-phase project intended to further facilitate trade and transport integration in the region by addressing institutional, legal, policy and infrastructure constraints. Hence the SATTF project would support Bank and country goals for improved management of public and private resources through promoting a more efficient operation of road and rail transport, enhancing border crossing and sea-ports operations, supporting regional integration by increasing cooperation between the border crossing agencies, as well as harmonizing procedures and enhancing transparency for all aspects of transit operations, including customs revenue collection. This phase I SATTF project will be focused on institution building for management of the Dar corridor which must be accorded a high priority, given the issues related to the transport of goods for DRC, Zambia and Malawi, to and from Dar es Salaam port.  An effective DCC will be essential to convening stakeholders for key SATTF project as a whole, and also to serving as an entry point for corridor performance monitoring. The components of this Technical Assistance Grant include: (i)Institutional arrangements for transit and  transport Facilitation; .   Support the strengthening of the DCC as an institution that can better manage transit and transport operations, and the reduction of NTBs along the corridor; .   Support specific components of the DCC work program; (ii)   Support for Tazara, RSZ and SNCC rail cargo transport inter connection .   Assess the optimal economic role for each railway in moving mining freight between Dar es Salaam port and the copper belt in Zambia and the DRC; .    Help develop agreements for wagon and locomotive interchange agreements between the railways .   Carry out feasibility studies for priority railway improvements. This activity has now been merged with the parent project P120370, so will be dropped.</a><br />
