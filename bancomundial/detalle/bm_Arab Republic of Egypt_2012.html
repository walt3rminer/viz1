Specifically, the project will  promote the IWRM principles and practices through (i) awareness-raising, institutional and capacity strengthening, and demonstration activities implemented in the selected pilot schemes in the Niel Delta to improve the coordination among water project management units (PMUs), Government agencies, local authorities and water user associations (WUAs); and (ii) technical assistance (TA) on targeted studies, capacity building training, and provision of equipment to strengthen the capacity and knowledge of the national institutions in water sector and to improve the national water resources monitoring networks.The global objective of this project is to establish the basis for scaling up investments through the GOE's IWRM plan and contribute more significantly to pollution control and improved ecosystem health of the Mediterranean Sea and its biodiversity resources. It is expected that the successful operationalization of the IWRM approach and principles in pilot schemes will demonstrate the benefits of synergy of the ongoing investment projects (IIIMP, NDP2, and ISSIP) and will be replicated in the NileDelta, which will result in increased water use efficiency and availability for reuse, and improved water quality and livelihood ofthe poor; which would eventually have a great impact on reducing the pollution load flowing into the Mediterranean Sea (the objectiveof Sustainable MED).</a><br />
