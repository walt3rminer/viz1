Armenian Railway (AR) is a state owned corporation, whose shares are currently controlled on behalf of the government by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications. The railway is vertically integrated, and its management structure is production-oriented, not market-oriented. The government of Armenia wants to restructure the railway to make it more efficient and market responsive, and position it to support economic growth in Armenia. To support this change, PPIAF funded a consultancy that examined restructuring options for AR (Armenian Railway Restructuring, 2006). In order to improve rail transport services and reduce the pending demand for government financial support, the study recommended concessioning the railway. The government has decided to concession the railway and selected the vertically integrated concession option recommended by the PPIAF funded study. It has committed to conduct a transparent competitive process for the concession (not direct negotiations).  A Ministerial Group has been appointed to steer the concessioning process and they will be supported by a Working Group of professional local experts and a PPIAF funded consultant. The proposed lending will provide the conditions for successful concessioning of Armenia's rail operations by putting the concessioning framework into action through: (1) Consultancy to assist the Government to implement the concession. (2) Funding for (a) copensation package for excess labor, (b) rehabilitation of very long-life infrastructure (e.g., bridges), and (c) other immediate rehabilitation needs.</a><br />
