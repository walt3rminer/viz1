The proposed new component would reconstruct flood pro tection embankments and irrigation headworks and conveyance canals that have bee n destroyed or severely damaged by floods.  The development objective of the pro posed additional component would be to improve and secure the sustainability of river flood protection works and irrigation headworks and canals, which, if unat tended, could lead to increased flooding occurrences and infrastructure damage, and subsequent human life and economic losses.</a><br />

After 26 months of implementation, the geographical scope of the above objective has been determined to refer to the central part of the Northern Caucasus in Georgia and to the protected areas in Eastern Georgia. The project will (i) support protected areas planning in the Central and Eastern Caucasus; (ii) establish protected areas management and build awareness of biodiversity conservation at three sites in the Eastern Caucasus and their ecological corridors; and (iii) reorganize and strengthen the Department of Protected Areas to conserve and manage biodiversity.  The project is consistent with the GEF Operational Program for biodiversity conservation. The project would have strong strategic and operational linkages with the Forests Development Project.</a><br />

Georgia has  considerable potential for transit of hydroca rbons, particularly by comparison to its other economic assets.   However, realizing positive net benefits fro m large transit investments (in a very complex geopolitical context)  requires very careful management by the State and substantial institution building.</a><br />
