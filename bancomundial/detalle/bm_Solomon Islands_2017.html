<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P152779" target=_blank>The proposed project would consist of a 15 MW hydropower plant located on the Tina River, east of Honiara comprising: (i) a 50m-high roller-compacted-concrete (RCC) dam located in a narrow gorge  on the Tina river; (ii) a 3.3km headrace tunnel, 3 m in diameter, to convey water from the dam to the power station; (iii) a powerhouse about 3-4 km downstream from the dam site that will house 3x5 MW Francis turbine machines; (iv) 2 parallel (on separate towers) 33kV single circuit transmission lines connecting the power station to the existing Lungga diesel power station; and (v) access roads; and other ancillary facilities.  Financing requirements are currently estimated at around US$120 million. The feasibility studies were substantially completed in March 2014 and include confirmation of a viable site, preparation of preliminary designs for the project and a full safeguards scoping assessment. The project, except the access roads will be implemented by a company to be set up by a private developer to be selected, on a build-own-operate-transfer basis under a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the state-owned SIEA, which will be guaranteed by the SIG.</a><br />
