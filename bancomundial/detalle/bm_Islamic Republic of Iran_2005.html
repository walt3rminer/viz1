The project's development objective is to demonstrate the benefits of the IWRM at the river basin level by: (a) sustainably increasing agricultural productivity through the improved irrigation and drainage system and participatory management mechanism; (b) reducing soil erosion and sediments yields into the Alborz Dam, which is currently under construction using the Islamic Republic of Iran's funds, through the improved upper watershed management; and (c) protecting the water environment downstream of the Babol River and other water bodies through improved hydrological/water quality monitoring reservoir operation, and pest management.</a><br />
