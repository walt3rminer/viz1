The program objective is to provide long-term support to accelerate agricultural recovery and growth so that Moldova's agricultural sector can play its full role in providing the underpinnings for future income growth and poverty reduction.  Within this broader objective, the project objective is to foster post-privatization growth in the agricultural sector by improving the access of new private farmers and rural businesses to what they need to succeed - legal ownership status, kno wledge, know-how, and finance. The first phase will initiate priority interventions in policy, legal and regulatory reforms, institutional capacity building technical assistance, and investment s upport.</a><br />

These activities are in line with the Climate Change Convention Kyoto P rotocol and are aimed to prevent the global warming. The main objectives of the project are : (a). To prepare a concrete program for  afforestation of degradated agricultural land; (b)To estimate the total CO2 abatement from the project implementation; (c) To ident ify specific global and local social and ecological benefits; The project preparing and implementing is supported by the World Bank Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF). The main goal of the Fund is to mitigate the climate change and demonstrate the possibilities of public -private partnerships in this area , and to offer a "learning-by-doing" opportunity to its stakeholders.</a><br />
