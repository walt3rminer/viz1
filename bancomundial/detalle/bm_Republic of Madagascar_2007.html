<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">40000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P099420" target=_blank>In line with the new Country Assistance Strategy for Madagascar, a series of single tranche Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), provided in the form of budget support, is envisaged to support implementation of key components of the new Madagascar PRSP called the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP).  The focus of the series is centered on: (i) governance and budget management reform and (ii) improved systems for service delivery in education, health, nutrition, water and sanitation.  The new PRSC series will continue to support the Government to implement its comprehensive governance reform program.  A key priority will be the consolidation of the reforms initiated under the first PRSC series (PRSC 1, 2 and 3), mainly to further refine the regulatory and institutional governance framework which has been developed since 2003, to close existing gaps, and to improve impact of governance related activities.  Additional support will be given to governance reforms, in particular governance challenges in selected entities such as the revenue agencies and in sensitive sectors such as the forestry and the mining sectors. Reforms in these areas will provide an important test for the efficiency and effectiveness of the existing governance framework. Regarding basic service delivery, the objective of the series is to accompany the process of institutional strengthening and quality improvements underway in the sectors.  More specifically, the PRSCs will complement the Bank#s existing investment portfolio by reinforcing institutional rationalization and strengthening in nutrition and by supporting the implementation of sector-wide approaches in health, education and water supply.</a><br />

This first phase of a 15-year Adaptable Program Loan (APL)microfinance program will support achievement of these objectives through the implementation of four components:  1. Development of an appropriate legal/regulatory and supervisory framework for microfinance institutions; 2. Establishment of MFIs and in particular savings and loan associations (SLAs) in four of Madagascar's six provinces (Antananarivo, Antsiranana, Fianarantsoa, and Toamasina). If studies confirm their viability, programs will be started in the two remaining provinces (Mahajanga and Toliary). 3. Design and testing of a pilot national training program; 4. Undertaking of studies related to microfinance to expand knowledge in the field.</a><br />
