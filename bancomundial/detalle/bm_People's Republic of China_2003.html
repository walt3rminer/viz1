Improved livelihood is defined as increased income; reduced risks; increased employment, in particular of women; and improved access to irrigation and drainage, technologies, information, training, and markets.</a><br />

Approvals from Provincial and Regional Development and Planning  Committees in Sichuan and Ningxia Hui, respectively,  have delayed MOA submitting the project proposal to the State Development and Planning Commission.  These approvals from Anhui, Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia have already been submitted.  Also, approval the Environmental Assessment report's outline will not be achieved until late May 2001 after which the EA and the respective report will be finalized.</a><br />

The project would empower farmer and herder households in project areas to better manage their grassland resources and improve the forage and feed production on arable lands.  More efficient and quality focused livestock production would increase the farmers and herders incomes and generate marketable surplus to improve living standards.  Developing efficient livestock marketing systems in the project counties would also increase the efficiency of the whole livestock production system and contribute raising the living standards of farmers and herders.</a><br />

This is being achieved by providing suitable breeding habitat, comprehensively surveying the biological environment of the Lake and its immediate tributaries, establishing a program to monitor lake quality improvements (using the presence/abundance of the endemic species as indicators of improved ecosystem health), and improving public awareness of the Lake region's unique biological environment. Project components include: (i) Wetland management and restoration; (ii) Surveys, monitoring and species conservation; (iii) Capacity building and training; and, (iv) Public Awareness.</a><br />

(b) Through the construction of a pumped storage plant (4 x 250 MW) and associated transmnission in Yixing to ease acute peaking problems and improve the generation mix that would create the conditions for more flexible dispatch and improved supply reliability, an essential requirement for well-functioning competitive markets.</a><br />
