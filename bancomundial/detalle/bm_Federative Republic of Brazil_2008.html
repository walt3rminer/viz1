The main performance indicators are: (i) the percentage increase in the volume of bulk water supplied by COGERH, the states water resources management company; (ii) the increased reliability of water supply and resistance against droughts; (iii) the implementation of new and/or improved water resources management, operation and maintenance tools; (iv) increase in the number of users with enhanced reliable access to quality water; and (v) the percentage of recovery for fixed and variable costs of providing water.  b. Stimulate multiple use, efficient and shared management of Ceará's water resources. The project would support the following actions: (i) organization and strengthening of river basin committees and water user associations; (ii) implementation and propagation of more effective water use and management technologies; and (iii) education, information and training of the general public and water users aimed at efficient water use, demand management and the reduction of waste. The main performance indicators are: (i) the increase in the number of river basin committees and water user associations, including the number of people participating in these entities; (ii) the decrease of the physical waste of water and the increased productivity in the economic sectors which use water as a production input; (iii) the percentage of billed water services v/s collections of bills. c. Promote the improved management of soil and vegetation in tributary watersheds to enhance water conservation, minimize erosion and maximize natural water storage mechanisms, through the adequate management of critical micro-basins and groundwater resources. The project would foster the hydro-environmental recovery of selected micro-basins in the state by increasing the vegetated area, controlling run-off, minimizing erosion, increasing water retention times, increasing groundwater recharge, developing aquifer management plans and recharge zone protection plans, improving the local infrastructure and production methods; and by evaluating new technologies. The main performance indicators are: (i) hectares of rehabilitated watershed vegetation, (ii) number of micro-basins stabilized, (iii) measured runoff hydrographs as a function of time and volume for specific microbasins, (iv) measurement of volumetric erosion in key microbasins and sedimentation change in key catchments, (v) number of recharge protection zones established, (vi) number of aquifer and groundwater management plans developed.</a><br />

The project will include two components. The first will support the design and implementation of a federal system of housing subsidies based on the recent experience of the PSH and as part of the recently approved National housing Fund.  The second component will support the design and implementation of the National Upgrading Program based on a system of block-grants negotiated between the federal and local governments.  The SWAP system will follow the design tested under the Municipal Health program. TO BE DROPPED - REASON This project was designed as part of the Housing DPL series.  The bulk of preparation funds was spent in FY04 for the initial design, which led to the DPL..  Expenditures during the past 2 FYs were used to maintain a policy dialog in a ministry that had high amounts of staff turn-over.  The project  is no longer needed as the housing sector  figures prominently in Government's PAC( thanks in part to the success of the strong policy dialog and DPL).  A new TA project for broader support to PAC implementation may be identified.</a><br />

Under this program, there will be four separate loans totaling US$109.71.  They will be individual loans to four municipalities:  Uberaba, Teresina, Belo Horizonte and Recife.  The indvidual loan amounts will be: US$17.65 (Uberaba); US$28.30 Teresina; US$32.76 (Recife): and US$31.00 (Belo Horizonte).  Each loan will be prepared individually, but packaged under this program as part of a programmatic approach to municipal lending in Brazil.  The first loan to be prepared will be Uberaba, followed by the other three within the program.  The program also allows for other municipalities, with loans that fit the program criteria, to be prepared under this program in the future.  This activity relates to the specific preparation of the Belo Horizonte sub-loan TO BE DROPPED - REASON The municipal government was able to secure grant financing from the federal government from the PAC program to finance the project.  A letter is being sent from the municipality to the Bank to explain the circumstances and confirm that the project will be fully implemented with their own resources (so our preparation work was not "lost")</a><br />

The Project will finance matching grants to rural community associations to finance productive and social sub-projects identified by these groups as priority investmemte that will improve community well-being. After approval of sub-projects by the state technical unit project funds will be dirsursed directly to commmunity associations whcih manage sub-project implementation and maintenance.
