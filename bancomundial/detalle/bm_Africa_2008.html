This will facilitate the re-utilization of oil revenues for investment in Central Africa. The project supports programs approved by the member governments designed to improve the efficiency of regional institutions. This will be accomplished by strengthening regional institutions. Project outcome indicators are given in Annex 3 and include increases in the percentage of foreign reserves managed regionally byBEAC, growth of investment in regional projects (primarily infrastructure investments), and increases in the percentage of banks meeting key prudential norms.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">40000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P094268" target=_blank>The objective is to reduce human suffering and damages, as well as capture the benefits of excess flood waters resulting from flooding in the Eastern Nile.  Flood Preparedness and Early Warning in the Eastern Nile Climate and river flows in the Eastern Nile, which includes Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt,  are highly variable.  The region is prone to extremes of floods and droughts.  During high rainfall periods, major rivers are prone to large-scale riverine flooding, particularly in the extensive floodplains of Sudan and areas in Ethiopia.  Major floods in the region directly result in loss of life and significant economic damages, particularly for the poor in the floodplains.  Despite the transboundary nature of flooding, there is no cooperative flood warning system.  Floodplain management activities to reduce the impacts of floods are limited, and emergency response is largely reactive. As a first joint flood project, and among the first in a series of cooperative projects among the Eastern Nile countries, this project will primarily focus on risk management and non-structural approaches to reducing the impacts of riverine flooding. Activities will focus on floodplain management and mitigation planning, flood forecasting and warning, and emergency response and preparedness at regional, national, and community levels.  This will contribute to the long-term goal of establishing a comprehensive and regional approach to flood management, which integrates watershed, river and floodplain management, and incorporates a wide range of structural and non-structural flood mitigation options within a broad, multipurpose framework.  The project will also provide critical experience in joint river management, and lay a solid foundation for broader regional cooperation and investment in river basin management and development, and particularly for the Eastern Nile Multipurpose Program described below.. Formal Concept Note review meeting was held on January 12, 2005.  Preparation will be initiated in FY05. Note on 03/24/2008: Flood Preparedness and Early Warning Project (FPEW) is being implemented in phases.  Phase 1(FPEW-I) is a grant financed project through the Nile Basin Trust Fund which was approved last year.  Phase 2 of the project (FPEW II, P094268) has four components (Ethiopia, Sudan, Egypt and Regional ). The  Ethiopia component will be financed through the $45m IDA Tana Beles Integrated Water Resources Development Project (TBIWRDP:P096323) through subsuming under TBIWRDP.  TBIWRDP is slated for Board this fiscal. The rest of the components (Sudan, Egypt and Regional) are likely to be financed through trust fund. Hence we will  drop FPEW II, P094268 (PE lending code) and create a new recipient executed (RE) project activity for this  in due time. Therefore, we are dropping this project at this time.  CD16 (Mark Tomlinson) already approved in his em of March 25, 2008</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P091970" target=_blank>The proposed Regional Atmospheric Deposition Monitoring Network Project (which will be referred to as the Equatorial Atmospheric Deposition Network or EADN) will establish and operate a regional, wet/dry deposition, monitoring network across equatorial Africa, and tie these data into atmospheric mass transport models of materials transfer helping to identify important sources of these materials.  This Project has its origins in 3 large GEF-supported projects on African Great Lakes.  These project on Lake Tanganyika, Lake Malawi/Nyassa, and Lake Victoria all yielded data strongly linking macronutrients (particularly phosphorous as the limiting element) to changes in trophic status.  Surprisingly, the source of the macronutrients driving this process was overwhelmingly from atmospheric deposition directly onto the surface of these lakes.  While data from these projects clearly identified the nature and scope of the problem, the data were not sufficient to establish the likely sources of the material and contribution ranking (either within or regionally, outside, the lake basins). The objective of this proposed project is to provide regional input into government interventions targeting rural development, and particularly those targeting  land use management, soil fertility, livestock and agricultural productivity, that would allow the estimation of their offsite impacts associated inflow of macronutrients (and particularly phosphorous) into African lakes.</a><br />

The overall development objective of the program is to develop and implement a sustainable framework for the management of selected watersheds within a framework of regional cooperation. This will be operationalized through enhancing the management of selected watersheds to improve standards of living of the population living within these watersheds in the Eastern Nile region; to reduce sediment transport and siltation of infrastructure, to improve agricultural productivity, and enhance vegetation cover and diversity.</a><br />
