The credit aims to enhance the Government#s ability to accelerating economic growth and improve the efficiency of its social programs and public administration # key elements in poverty reduction. The credit complements and reinforces other Bank Group programs in Moldova, the IMF-supported PRGF and other donor activities.    Closely aligned with Country Assistance Strategy, the PRSC will support the objectives of the EGPRSP and EU-Moldova Action Plan: # Improving the Investment Climate.  Moldova is entering a new phase in its economic development where consumption driven growth # based on the export of labor and inflow of remittances # can no longer be expected to sustain current growth rates over the medium term.   Sustaining and accelerating future growth and poverty reduction in Moldova will depend on increases in domestic productivity.  Achieving faster productivity growth, as well as employment generation, will depend on the extent to which firms and farms address the current low levels of investment and innovation.  The Government#s agenda focuses on improving further improving the investment climate for private sector development. # Improving the Efficiency and Management of Public Resources.   Better governance and institutions are central to growth and poverty reduction.  The EGPRSP and EU Action Plan are conscious of the constraint imposed by the insufficient functional and institutional adaptation of the public administration to the requirements set by the transition from a central planned economy to a market economy.The EGPRSP and EU Action Plan recognize that establishing a modern and efficient public administration is necessary in order to achieve the country#s longer-term development outcomes.   Increasing the efficiency of public expenditures will be critical if the government is to increase public investment from its current low levels. # Strengthening Pension and Social Assistance Systems.  The Government#s program to improve delivery of utility, infrastructure and social services is reflected in the EGPRSP. The PRSC, together with IDA#s investment projects and donor assistance, would support strengthening the effectiveness and future fiscal viability of pension and social assistance programs.</a><br />
