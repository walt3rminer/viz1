<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">200000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P115638" target=_blank>The program development objective is the establishment of an appropriate policy framework for an efficient national safety net system.   The proposed DPC support falls under pillar III of the CAS: supporting the poor and vulnerable. The CAS recognizes that the existing social assistance programs cover a very small fraction of the poor, provide negligible benefits, and suffer from ineffective targeting, weak administration, and a lack of monitoring and evaluation. To this end, the CAS notes that the Bank#s support will include support for safety nets that will (i) help the chronic poor cope with poverty, and where possible; (ii) help the poor escape poverty, e.g., via conditional cash transfers; and (iii) help families and households cope with seasonal shocks.  The proposed DPC is fully consistent with the PRSP 2, which identifies assisting the poor and the vulnerable as a key objective of Government#s poverty reduction strategy. The proposed DPC is also consistent with the National Social Protection Strategy that supports the development of an effective and financially sustainable safety net system to promote the re-distributive goals of society</a><br />
