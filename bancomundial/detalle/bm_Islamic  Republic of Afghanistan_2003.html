What is needed is clear progress along these parameters. 1. The contraceptive prevalence rate would have increased by ten percent (10%) among women using modern family planning methods. 2. The cure rate among detected tuberculosis cases would have increased to eighty percent (80%). 3. The proportion of children aged six (6) months to fifty-nine (59) months that have received vitamin A supplement woud have increa sed to ninety percent (90%). 4. Fully-Immunize-Child vaccine coverage among children aged twelve (12) months to twenty-three (23) months would have increased by  thirty-five percent (35%).</a><br />
