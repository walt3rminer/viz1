The project would raise awareness and support for earthquake safety amongst the community at large by developing models of comprehensive safety in schools and hospitals. The project duration would be one year. Key indicators that the project is successfully meeting HFA-established benchmarks include: - School safety programs created in twelve schools in three different settings (two country capitals and one province/state with severe seismic hazard) that demonstrate raising earthquake safety awareness of staff, students and parents; forming a school safety committee; correctly anchoring objects that can fall; developing a school preparedness plan; and conducting preparedness drills; - Hospital safety programs in one major hospital in each of three different settings that demonstrate raising earthquake safety awareness of the staff; forming a hospital emergency preparedness committee; correctly anchoring and bracing objects that can fall or break; and developing a hospital emergency preparedness plan; - A community earthquake safety program, including a community workshop, in one mountain community to raise awareness and empower community members to begin reducing their earthquake risk; - Three reports describing an initial seismic vulnerability assessment of the project schools and hospitals, with recommendations for further mitigation actions, if needed; - Standardized checklists for identifying potential falling hazards and other important objects that can be damaged by earthquakes in schools and hospitals in the region; - A falling hazards mitigation manual for schools in three local languages; and - Sensitization of government officials, additional school administrators, and additional hospital administrators to local earthquake risks and steps they can take to reduce their risk, via two one-day workshops to be held in each of the three settings mentioned above. The project is expected to demonstrate a replicable model for school and hospital safety and thus, to generate interest in and demand for school and hospital earthquake safety projects and investments in the physical infrastructure for education and health in the countries concerned, and in other parts of the region. The project#s activities are an initial step toward safeguarding schools and hospitals from the threat of earthquakes.</a><br />

The grant will support the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) in the development and trial of a novel vaccine candidate - the Sendai Vector, with a work program of 5 years and a requested budget of $10M. The prevention of HIV infection by an effective vaccine remains the single intervention that has feasible potential to reverse and eradicate the global AIDS epidemic, with profound implications for the development of affected countries and populations. This grant supports IAVI in the search for a preventative HIV vaccine as a Global Public Good through a program of fundamental laboratory, epidemiological and clinical research.</span></a><br />

The GTI, a partnership of tiger range countries and international organisations, was initiated by the President of the World Bank and a number of international institutions in June 2008.  Its objective is to mobilize public opinion, political commitment and support actions which can reverse the threat of extinction facing the tiger in the wild. Through a focus on the wild tiger, whose global population has declined from 35,000 to 3,500 over the recent 30 years, GTI aims to bring wildlife conservation as an item on the global agenda.  Scientists have established that unless current trends are reversed quickly, tiger populations will disappear from the wild by 2020.  Given that needed wild tiger conservation actions are quite well known, GTI's mission is to mobilize political will and sustain concerted actions to turn the situation around, as a demonstration of our collective will. GTI encompasses a range of activities and instruments.  The on-going and planned GTI activities and processes aim to: (i) build global public awareness of the seriousness of the threat of extinction; (ii)   harvest the collective knowledge of the global tiger community to build fresh momentum and re-energize country specific Tiger conservation actions; (iii) build high-level political support for the implementation of national programs as well to supplement these with international support for trans boundary actions. (iv)   create a global Tiger Stabilization and Recovery action program to support game changing actions needed to reverse the threat of extinction; (v)   mobilize technical and financial resources as requested by TRCs; and, (vi) rigorously monitor and report to national leaders progress, achievements and emerging constraints. The trans-boundary aspects of tiger conservation include the critical dimension of law enforcement to curb the illegal trans-border and domestic trade in tiger parts, global campaigns are also needed to eliminate the demand for tiger based products and joint action to preserve trans-border tiger ranges. GTI is building momentum through participative processes. While a workshop in Pattaya (Thailand) in April 2009 focused on law enforcement against illegal trans-boundary trade in wildlife, the Kathmandu Global Tiger Workshop (October 2009) reviewed the status of National Tiger Conservation Action Plans in light of global experience.  It helped each country identify game-changing actions needed to reverse the current trajectory and developed specific recommendations for taking back to their capitals.  These range from a global campaign for eliminating demand for tiger parts and derivatives, strengthening in-country and trans-border law enforcement, curbing irresponsible infrastructure and land use changes, improving protected area management and promotion of eco-tourism and engagement with local communities.  New ways to raise resources for conservation were also identified.  Some countries are already launching the implementation of their game-changing ideas. The first Asian Ministerial Conference on Tiger Conservation in Hua Hin (at the end of January 2010) is expected to help TRC political leaders define bold programs aimed at averting the threat to extinction, by engaging a wider set of stakeholders in wildlife/tiger conservation.  Law enforcement, infrastructure and ecotourism officials and specialists will join conservation decision-makers in helping define the key elements of a Global Tiger Stabilization and Recovery Program.  The shape of the political, management and financial instruments to support the implementation National Action Plans and to provide needed support from the international community will also be identified.  TRCs are expected to demonstrate leadership by launching priority actions within their influence, without waiting for the Summit. The Summit of Heads of Governments in September 2010 in Vl</a><br />
