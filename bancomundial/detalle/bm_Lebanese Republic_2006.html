The former project, despite a slow start and difficult post-conflict conditions, succeeded in implementing a series of far-reaching policy reform initiatives . in addition to rehabilitating public hospital service provision.  These reform efforts encompassed the areas of provider payment, national health accounts, health sector mapping and hospital accreditation. The GOL now seeks Bank assistance in expanding these initiatives and implementing new reforms, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector.  Key Development Issues and Project Rationale: - The health sector in Lebanon, notwithstanding the positive results of the project, still faces many significant challenges.  Health expenditure as a percentage of GDP (12.3 percent) is the highest in the region and more than half the population is formally uninsured. The overall health financing system is inefficient and inequitable.  Six different public funds exist and almost 60 percent of health spending is paid out of pocket. Spending on drugs is exorbitantly high given the lax regulatory environment and little generic substitution exists.  Service delivery is highly skewed in favor of curative-based hospital care and the primary health care system remains relatively weak.  In view of the overall positive GOL-Bank partnership in health and the explicit commitment of the Ministry of Health toward health sector reform, evidenced by the political capital and financial resources already committed to certain initiatives (e.g. GIS-based health mapping, public health insurance integration efforts and hospital accreditation),  serious consideration ought to be given to the GOL loan request. Other international partners such as  the U.N. agencies (WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA) are involved only programmatically in the areas of disease surveillance, health promotion, child health, nutrition, immunization and primary health care and are not invested more substantially in the high-level health policy reform discussions of the country. WHO assisted with the implementation of several policy studies under the previous project. At the bilateral level, one Italian sponsored project is focusing on primary health care and small-scale experiments with new provider payment methods (i.e. capitation for perinatal care services).  The Bank is currently the only international organization in Lebanon positioned to play a significant policy  role in the area of health care reform.
