The program development objective is to adopt policies and reforms that support more efficient governance and contribute to broad based growth by easing the key constraints posed by low agriculture productivity, low skills base, and the high cost of infrastructure services in Rwanda.  The PRSF-7 supports the implementation of the Government's medium-term development strategy, the EDPRS, within the context of a satisfactory macroeconomic framework. The Financing is closely aligned with the CPAF, which was prepared under Government leadership in consultation with development partners. The PRSF-7 is the fourth and last operation in the second series of PRSFs. The PRSF-7 builds on the past operations’ support to the Government in the core areas of: (i) sustainably raising agricultural production; (ii) increasing access to infrastructureservices; (iii) strengthening the framework for post-basic education, to build a skilled workforce and promote science and technology; (iv) deepening the financial sector; and (v) strengthening the management of public resources at the central and local levels.  Overall, PRSF-7 continues to follow the areas of reforms identified under PRSG-4 in the agriculture, infrastructure and social sectors.</a><br />
