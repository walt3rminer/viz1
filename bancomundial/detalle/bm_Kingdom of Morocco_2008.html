This project was under preparation as a GEF "Companion" to the Morocco Integrated Forestry and Rural Development Project (P075561). The main reasons why the Biodiversity Conservation in Bas Draa National Park was dropped were: The Morocco Integrated Forestry and Rural Development Project (P075561) was abandoned because the financing mechanisms conditions required for a successful implementation of the project were not met by the Government. Therefore the idea of a GEF companion was not feasible; The Bas Draa National Park is located on land that the local communities considered as their own collective land and the Bank missions found out that possible conflicts might occur if the project was to be implemented as proposed by the Government; and The preparation process occurred in the middle of a reorganization period within the implementing agency with staff changes and insufficient commitment to the project . The idea of a separate Medium Size Project was considered but not supported by the GEF. NOTE:  This activity is dropped by Pierre Rondot on behalf of Mr. Abdelkrim Oka (UPI#20593), Task Team Leader, who has retired from the Bank.</a><br />

(One tranche loan (Eur 66.0 million) to be disbursed upon effectiveness)  Board Schedule Comments The loan will focus on the following activities: 1. Sustain payroll reduction with supportive measures; 2. Define new working employment categories for public servant; 3. Support decentralization of civil servants; 4. introduce performance-based budgeting in a medium term expenditure framework 12/11: ROC postponed from Dec. 20 to Jan. 2008. The main reason is that the Government has rescheduled our appraisal mission to February 4-8 and that gives us a bit of more time to finalize the Project Document, while introducing some important updates on the new Government's priorities into the loan. This is a Programmatic PARL.  Therefore the ICR is prepared within 6 months after the closing date of the last operation in the programmatic series but no later than 30 months after the board approval of the previous operations in the series. PARL IV Board is scheduled for 3/25/10.</a><br />
