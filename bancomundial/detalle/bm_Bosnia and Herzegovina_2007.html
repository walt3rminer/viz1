To achieve this, three areas will be supported by the project: (i) prevention, (ii) preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and containment.  Achieving these goals will contribute to diminishing the burden of disease and loss of productivity, limiting the regional spread of HPAI, and enhancing economic and social prospects at the national, regional, and global levels.</a><br />
