Infrastructure services include transport (roads, bridges, and port works), water supply, sanitation, ICT, and electricity (with emphasis on renewable technologies). On a broader level, the project will also support the decentralization agenda of the Borrower, as a way to increase ownership, accountability, and social inclusion responsiveness to local needs. Improving mechanisms for identifying local investments andincreasing public investment efficiency are priorities of the decentralization agenda that is being undertaken by SUBDERE (#Revoluci√≥n Descentralizadora#).</a><br />

The TAL and an associated DPL were both approved by the World Bank Board in June 2007. This grant on "Integrating Biodiversity Conservation in Infrastructure Planning" will finance complementary activities focusing on methodologies to minimize biodiversity impacts.  These methodologies will be applied on a pilot basis to some large and programmatic investments currently in the planning phase, such as a highway being routed through priority ecosystems and a major hydroelectric dam in Patagonia.</a><br />
