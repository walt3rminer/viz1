The project, sponsored by the Philippine National Oil Company Energy Development Corporation (PNOC-EDC), would drill an additional production well at the Palimpinon geothermal site in the southern part of  Negros Island, build a fluid collection and reinjection system to transport the steam and hot water to a 20 MW turbo-generator, and deliver the electricity generated to the Visayas grid. Using an indigenous and renewable energy resource, the proposed $34 million project will obviate the need for equivalent capacity of barge-mounted diesels that are being used to temporarily alleviate power shortages in the area, thus mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. No World Bank Group investment financing is sought. Following guidelines used in Bank projects, the Activity will conduct due diligence on environmental, social and legal aspects and, to a more limited extent, on technical and financial aspects of the proposed project.</a><br />

Luzon would establish an institution for basin and watershed management and undertake a first phase of basin and watershed management initiatives including watershed management, irrigation improvement, flood mitigation and rural development, involving stakeholders and communities;  and (ii)  a component at the national level would support establishment and operations of two task forces to prepare water resources management action plans for Manila and Cebu, the two most pressing water constrained areas in the Philippines.</a><br />
