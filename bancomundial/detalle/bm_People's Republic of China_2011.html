The project project proponent is Baosteel Group Pudong Iron and Steel Co. Ltd.  The ERs will be generated through the application of COREX technology which directly de-oxidize iron ore to hot metal instead of conventional blust furnace process and has a high energy saving potential. The development objective of the project is to reduce CO2 emissions from a large iron and steel company compared with the baseline scenario through a carbon finance transaction, thereby to help China to participate in global efforts to mitigate climate change.</a><br />

The project development objective remains the same: support Weihai to realize its goal of being a green public-transport oriented ecological and livable city by improving the quality of public transport and non-motorized transport systems in critical corridors in Weihai for citizens who travel on these corridors. The project includes four components, public transport corridor construction, ITS, low-carbon bus demonstration, and institutional development and capacity building.</a><br />

This objective seeks to contribute to: (i) improving living conditions in rural areas-particularly those in the areas of the Province where poverty rates are higher-by enhancing the transport accessibility of the rural communities to economic opportunities and social services; (ii) stimulating higher economic growth in Fujian Province by reducing transport costs; and (iii) facilitating the interconnection across the coastal provinces.  In this respect, the project will meet both the provincial government objective to improve the transport network to support the social and economic development of the province (especially in the economically lagging counties), and the central government objective to facilitate transport interconnections across Coastal Provinces.</a><br />
