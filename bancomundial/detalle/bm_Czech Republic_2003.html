In this particular case, the project will function as an umbrella to facilitate the implementation of several sub-projects in the Czech Republic of which three are presented for approval at this time. The sub-projects produce reductions of CO2 emissions through improved energy efficiency and/or energy substitution (e.g. substituting energy from renewable sources for energy produced from fossil fuels).</a><br />
