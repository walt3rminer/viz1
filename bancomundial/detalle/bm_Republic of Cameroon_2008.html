The Project would initially focus capacity building efforts towards the energy sector, in support of the Energy Sector Development Project.  The mobilization of supplemental resources to more explicitly address issues in the mining and transport sectors would be explored during the project's mid-term review.  The expected long-term benefits of the project are to: (i) reduce the negative externalities of large infrastructure projects, and (ii) develop a transparent, stable and fair framework for managing environmental and social risks that should comfort large infrastructure investments, and (iii) institutionalizes information flows between the populations affected by large infrastructure projects and other stakeholders, and political decision-makers.</a><br />

The project shall allow for the installation of about 40,000 household connections in urban areas countrywide over 5 years, equivalent to a 25% increase in the total number of water connections in the country. An estimated population of 240,000 people shall gain access to safe piped water (current urban coverage is estimated at 35%).</a><br />
