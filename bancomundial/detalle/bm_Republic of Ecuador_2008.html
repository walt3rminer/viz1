This project is being prepared in close coordination with the donor community on both the coast and the islands (the Donor Round Table on Galapagos), local governments, NGOs, and in particular the two regional government authorities (INGALA and PMRC). The possible components identified for the project include a) strategic and regional assessements of the Large Marine Ecosystem, b) conservation and geotourism based LED including alternative economic activites for artisanal fisherman in the Galapagos, c) community based disaster prevention and management, d) disseminating new knowledge via traditional music/narrative methods, e) municipal territorial planning and street addressing systems for city management, f) support the municipality of Guayaquil in the planning of Isla Santay, and preparation of the disaster prevention mitigation strategy for the city, and g) establish an integrated decision support system for GOE, PMRC and INGALA.</a><br />
