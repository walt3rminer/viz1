<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">8000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P073035" target=_blank>The PDO is to support the acquisition of land and the formation of sustainable farm enterprises by self-organized landless and land-poor peasant families. As a pilot program, the Land Access Pilot Project (PACTA) tests a public-private partnership strategy with interested private sector lending institutions for land purchase and the use of public sector funds, through the project, supporting complementary investments, and technical assistance to improve the productivity of the newly acquired properties. If successful, the Government would consider scaling up the pilot to a national fund mechanism for land purchase in several years.  The concentration of the best lands among a small percentage of landholders (less than 4% of farms have more than 50% of total land) in Honduras makes it extremely difficult for family scale producers to participate effectively in the land market. Private land is available to the smallest producers, since they do not have the needed collateral and cannot bid on the larger size productive plots that more often enter the market. PACTA is therefore designed to provide an economy of scale to small rural producers who wish to purchase land for productive activities. Such transfers would be likely to result in more intensive land uses. While individuals can also be beneficiaries, the majority of the participants are expected to be groups of producers who collectively identify land for sale, develop a business plan for that land, and assume collective responsibility for investment and repayment until the loan is paid off, and they can exercise their individual rights over their own parcels. Key performance indicators: (i) Volume of lending leveraged from private financial institutions for land purchase -,,Financial institutions develop appropriate methodology to deliver credit products for land purchase by target population; and devote at least US$2.5 million to this purpose. -,,At least seventy-five percent of families identifies as eligible by the Unidades Tecnicas Locales receive private financing for land purchase.  (ii) Quality of the loan portfolio -,,At least eighty-five percent of groups participating in the project are able to pay off land purchase loans and maintain viable enterprises (participant families negotiated land purchase, established legal structure, entered into credit contracts, and expanded new enterprises). (iii) Increase in income of participating families -,,At least 15% increase on family income through land productivity and output in acquired lands. (iv) Validation of a decentralized model for land access -,,Pilot evaluation leads to endorsement of expansion of program and PACTA is established as a national program operating in conformity with the tested implementation model. (v) Local social accountability and constituency building around the program -,,The functions attributed to the Consejo Directivo de PACTA have been absorbed by the Redes Regionales de Apoyo (the Regional Support Networks) to provide the constituency that would support the transformation of PACTA from a pilot project to a national program. The Regional Support Networks provide an articulation of operative local and national alliances, strengthen the project?s policies and procedures, enrich its norms and operational manual, and provide a social accountability for the use of funds.</a><br />

Specifically, the project would: (i) assist the GOH with the reconstruction, rehabilitation and improvement of roads and bridges included in Honduras Hurricane Mitch National Reconstruction Plan presented by the GOH at the Consultative Group Meeting held in Stockholm, Sweden, in May 1999; (ii) continue IDA support to improving road maintenance practices by providing TA to strengthen the organization of the Road Fund, and by implementing maintenance pilot projects through microenterprises to stimulate employment in the rural areas; and (iii) continue IDA support in strengthening the institutional capacity of SOPTRAVI to manage the transport sector, with particular emphasis on the road subsector. Achievements of project objectives will be monitored through the following indicators (see also Section 5.1 of Project Implementation Plan):  (i),,Rural access improved following the rehabilitation/construction of about 100 km of roads and 550 linear meters of bridges; (ii),,Vehicle operating costs and travel times will be reduced 35% and 20%,respectively,on the roads rehabilitated/improved by the project; (iii)The Road Fund will be fully operational and maintaining 50% of the national road network in the year 2001, 60% in 2002, 70% in 2003, and 80% in 2004; (iv),,Restructuring oof the Roads Direcorate will be completed; (v),,The Planning Unit (UPEG) of SOPTRAVI would have received training in HDM-IV and would have prepared a multi-year road investment program; (vi),,24 micro-enterprises will be working on road routine maintenance activities during 2001, and 20 more will be added in 2002 as well as in 2003 to complete the 64 micro-enterprises required for the maintenance of the paved network.</a><br />
