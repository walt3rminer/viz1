The Credit Agreement was signed on January 24, 2001. The Project was declared effective on June 29, 2001.

(d) Use of IT tools, tested in reform of commercial registry and diagnostic of Commercial Code. (3) Sustainability of the Presidential Competitiveness Commission (CPC) to facilitate private-public policy dialogue and to assist in implementing sector and policy reforms. The Project Development Objectives are realistic and well-defined, however, as stated in previous PSRs the lack of baseline indicators to monitor implementation of these objectives has been a major disadvantage. Efforts are being made to overcome this by consultants developing a set of such indicators and gathering the relevant data to allow their continuous monitoring.</a><br />
