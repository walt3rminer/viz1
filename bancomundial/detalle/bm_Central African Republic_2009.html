<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">5000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P113176" target=_blank>This operation directly supports two pillars of the CAR's PRSP: (i) promoting good governance and the rule of law (pillar 2); and (ii) rebuilding and diversifying the economy (pillar 3). The objective of the Economic Management and Governance Reform Grant II (EMGRG II) is to sustain and deepen reforms supported by the predecessor operations (RIBSUP, EMGRG I). The proposed grant focuses on two main policy areas: (i) strengthening public finance management; and (ii) improving public sector and economic governance. Public finance management is understood as public expenditure management and tax and customs administration. Public sector governance is understood as procurement, transparency and fight against corruption. Economic governance is understood as transparency and the quality of the regulatory framework in two key areas (forestry and mining).</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">8000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P114111" target=_blank>The project development objectives are to partially restore reliable electricity supply to Enerca's customers in Bangui, including essential service providers such as the water company and hospitals, and to improve the financial and operational performance of the sector.  In particular, the project will rehabilitate the Boali 1 and 2 hydropower facilities, thereby increasing reliable power supply.  Through the introduction of more efficient lighting devices, the project is expected to reduce peak electricity demand by up to 10%, and through the loss reduction and collection improvement components of the operation, including the introduction of pre-payment meters, the project is also expected to improve the utility's ability to generate more cash flow and coverage of operating and maintenance expenditure.</a><br />
