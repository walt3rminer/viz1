<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">52000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P070736" target=_blank>The Board approved revised PDO are:  (i) strengthen fiscal decentralization, improve accountability in the use of local government resources, and improve management of intergovernmental transfers and demand-driven urban investments; and  (ii) increase access to infrastructure and services in the unplanned areas of Dar es Salaam and improve revenue performance for sustainable operations and maintenance. Component 1 of LGSP is designed to support the GoT Local Government Capital Development Grant System, inter alia through provision system of capital and capacity building grants for local government authorities (LGAs). This component aims to support (i) a sound intergovernmental fiscal framework and (ii) capacity-building so that LGAs can better meet their service-delivery obligations. Together with bilateral donors, the Project targets all 132 LGAs in the country. Component 2 of LGSP focuses on Dar es Salaam, supporting the upgrading of infrastructure and services in unplanned settlements, and improving local revenue collection and systems for operation and maintenance of infrastructure. Component 3 is designed to strengthen capacity in the Prime Minister#s Office - Regional Administration and Local Government (PMO-RALG) to perform monitoring, oversight and management functions with respect to the grants supported by Component 1.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">150000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P074073" target=_blank>A policy dialogue and performance assessment framework under the PRSC-2 focuses on the following cross-cutting and institutional actions which will facilitate progress towards the PRS objectives:  (i) Sustain and accelerate economic growth and broaden its impact:  Reducing income poverty is one of the key focus areas of the PRS.  Private sector and rural development are the two areas where reforms are expected to have the biggest impact on reducing income poverty in Tanzania.  Reforms in the areas of agricultural and rural development are intended to improve producer incentives and raise agricultural profitability and thus enhance incomes in rural areas, where poverty is most widespread and most deeply entrenched.  Measures include improving export crop quality, reducing marketing cost and the tax burden on farmers and improving access to markets and finance.  With respect to private sector development, the focus will be on strengthening of the business environment, in particular for SMEs, and legal and administrative reforms to enhance the functioning of land, credit, and labor markets. (ii) Support results orientation of public service delivery: The second area of impact is through monitoring and leveraging progress in the implementation of sectoral programs to reduce poverty, covering the priority sectors identified in the PRS, i.e., primary education, basic health, water, rural roads, agricultural research and extension, the judiciary, and HIV/AIDS.  The PRSC-2 policy dialogue focuses on the establishment of a robust monitoring and evaluation system that allows an assessment of the impact and results of sectoral programs.  The information derived from the monitoring and evaluation system will then feed into the assessment of progress towards the PRS objectives, on which future PRSC support will be contingent.  Finally, the resources provided through the PRSC-2 complement government and other donor resources in financing priority programs for poverty reduction. The well developed participatory Public Expenditure Review and Medium Term Expenditure Framework (PER-MTEF) process provides a mechanism for the monitoring of the use of resources. (iii) Enhance public sector performance:  Measures in this area will have a direct impact on poverty reduction as they enhance public sector capacity to implement poverty reduction programs in the priority sectors and generate additional funds for poverty reduction by reducing leakages in the form of low allocative or operational efficiency of public expenditures.  Key areas of reform include strengthening of financial management through the implementation of the public financial management reform program, strengthening of the national audit office, implementation of pay reform coupled with improved performance management in the public sector, procurement reform, the implementation of anti-corruption strategies, and enhanced efficiency in the use of development assistance. (iv) Strengthen environmental management:  Finally, the PRSC-2 also supports government.s efforts to enhance the environmental sustainability of Tanzania.s development program.  The PRS identifies this as an important element of efforts to improve the quality of life and social well-being.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">190000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P090392" target=_blank>The PRSC1 credit/grant will support the implementation of Tanzania.s Poverty Reduction Strategy  by:  (a) Accelerating growth:  After nearly a decade of macro stabilization, structural reform and liberalization, the rate of growth of the Tanzanian economy remains low relative to the requirements for effective poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.   A key target therefore is to raise growth to between 6 and 7 percent in the medium term by promoting higher private investment, reducing the cost of doing business, and enhancing the efficiency of the Tanzanian economy. (b) Broadening the impact of growth:  About half of Tanzania.s output derives from the rural economy and more than 70 percent of its population depends on it for its livelihood.  Most of the GoT reforms to date have had a stronger impact in the urban and service sectors.  Hence the program of PRSCs will support efforts to spread the impact of both reforms and resultant growth to the rural income poor through: (i)Enhancement of the profitability of agriculture broadly and export products of rural origin in particular, (ii)improved product quality, higher productivity, reduced marketing cost and improved access to markets (iii)removal of remaining institutional constraints on rural activities;and (iv)correcting the disincentives  arising from the overall tax regime, specially those resulting from the overbearing/multiplicity of local taxes affecting income earning activities in rural areas. (c) Aligning public investment with PRS goals: In addition to continued efforts at improving the private investment climate, there is now a need to bring the development  budget of the GoT in line with the strategic public investment requirements to meet the PRS targets and support the growth of private sector contribution to the economy and livelihoods. (d) Increasing efficiency of public service delivery:  Building on processes that have been put in place to enhance the strategic allocation and impact of public resources for poverty reduction, increase the efficiency of public resource use through measures to further strengthen accountability mechanisms combined with capacity building at the local and central government level.</a><br />

The project will provide funds to assist in covering the incremental power supply costs attributable to the 2003 drought. Specifically, IDA's financial contribution would cover the incremental: (i) fuel costs of running the Ubungo Power Plant on Jet A1 fuel through July 2004 when the Ubungo Power Plant will be commissioned to operate on indigenous gas; and (ii) costs of purchasing electricity (kWh) produced from the IPTL Power Plant (100MW) operating on HFO through February 2005.  On November 5, 2004, the Government requested the financing of gas-based emergency power plant (40MW) to meet TANESCO's capacity and energy constraints. This is proposed for financing in lieu of JETA1 fuel since there were delays in commissioning the Ubungo Power Plant and it was not possible to run the power plant on JETA1 fuel during the extended rehabilitation phase of the plant. This is consistent with the Government's emergency power supply plan, and was envisaged as part of a contingency plan in the event that outcome of the long rains was insufficient in terms of water flows to replenish the main Mtera reservoir.</a><br />
