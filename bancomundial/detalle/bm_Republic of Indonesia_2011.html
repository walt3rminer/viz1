The current series is itself a continuation of two earlier series (Indonesia DPLs 1 through 4 and DPLs 5 to 6) and supports further reforms in the same three key areas: (1)improving the investment climate; (2)strengthening public financial management; and (3) enhancing poverty alleviation and service delivery efforts. Under each of these three areas the DPL program supports the advancement of a number of more specific reform aims. A preliminary set of indicative triggers for DPL-8 was suggested by the relevant GoI counterparts and agreed to during the preparation and appraisal of DPL-7. During the identification and preparation of DPL-8 the status of these actions will be reviewed and discussed with GoI counterparts in the new government that took office in October 2009. It is conceivable that in light of this dialogue, adjustments may need to be made to the proposed program. The work on the DPL program (including DPL-8) is closely integrated and coordinated with the ongoing technical assistance and advisory work being undertaken by the large TF-funded teams working in each of the three areas covered by the program.

The Government of Indonesia (GoI) has responded to the growing demand for energy by supporting PLN, the state-owned power company, in devising and implementing a program to construct 10,000 MW of coal-based generation capacity, which they see as one of the few immediately available options for expanding generation capacity at the lowest financial cost.  This decision, along with Indonesia's existing heavy use of diesel, will increase the dependence on fossil fuels and exacerbating local and global environmental impacts.  Consequently, the GoI plans to diversify the country's electricity generation mix and to ensure a more environmentally sustainable development of the sector.  Geothermal power is one of the best options to diversify Indonesia's energy mix.  As an indigenous and non-tradable energy source, geothermal is a base load generation technology not subject to the intermittency and variability of most renewable electricity sources, and it can also enhance the country's energy security and serve as a natural hedge against the volatility of fossil-based commodity prices.  GoI has set a target of developing 6,000 MW by 2020, but estimates suggest that only about a third of this total is likely to be developed under a business-as-usual scenario, mainly due to significantly large incremental financial cost of geothermal comparing to coal technology. To achieve the government's environment objectives and implement the ambitious geothermal program, GoI needs to address the incremental cost to make geothermal financially viable over the long term.  One of the options that can be adopted to bridge the incremental cost is to sell the emission reductions (ERs) from geothermal projects to enhance their financial viability. In response the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has requested the World Bank's assistance to scale up the utilization of carbon revenues in geothermal development.  The proposed project will establish a Carbon Finance (CF) Framework based on the programmatic CDM approach, for this purpose.  The CF Framework is expected to: (a) streamline and simplify the procedures for CDM transactions; (b) enhance the certainty of cash benefits to geothermal developers beyond 2012; and (c) access other potential ER buyers to generate additional cashflow for geothermal projects.

Sixty million hectares of land, about 44% of Indonesia's national forest estate, is classified as permanent production forest. Production forest is the predominant forest category in the lowlands and in areas where protected area coverage is low. It forms important biological corridors between protected areas, but also contains important forest habitats (especially lowland alluvial forests which are under-represented in the PA network and which are some of the most species-rich habitats on Earth). The area of natural forest within production forest decreased from 43 million hectares to 39 million hectares between 1997 and 2003. The decline was caused by illegal logging, non-sustainable concession management, and conversion to industrial timber plantations. In addition, three million hectares of production forest were re-classified as non-forest land in 2003, in response to demands for land for regional development. The most recent satellite data shows that deforestation rates in production forest decreased to pre-1990s levels in 2000, but has increased again over the last five years. The Indonesian Forestry Department has committed itself to stopping the conversion of intact forest sites for timber plantation and tree crop development, and to ban the use of mixed tropical hardwood fibre by the pulp and paper industry. It has cancelled the licences of many poorly-managed concessions and suspended the operations of others. Presently nearly half - 30 million hectares - of the production forest estate is not covered by any kind of exploitation licence. However when forests are taken out of production in this way, there are no resources to pay for their protection and management and many areas are threatened by agricultural encroachment. The concessions become open-access and may be rapidly deforested. Between 2003 and 2006, Burung Indonesia and a consortium of partners worked with the Forestry Department to develop the concept of 'Restoration in production forests' as an alternative approach for production forest which focuses on sustainable use of non-timber products and services, rather than over-exploiting timber. The core aim of this concept is to provide an alternative management model for production forests which still have much of their original structure, important biodiversity and social values. In 2004 the Government issued an innovative new policy, and Burung Indonesia and its international partners bid for, and won, the right to manage the first restoration concession, located in the lowland forests of Sumatra. The Harapan concession covers 101,000 ha of selectively logged forest lands and includes some of Sumatra's last remaining lowland forests. This is an important area for tigers and other Sumatran megafauna including tigers, tapirs and primates.  *****  Based on experiences in planning, financing and managing the Harapan concession, this project aims to replicate the "ecosystem restoration" model in other high biodiversity areas in Indonesia by developing at least three more credible, successful examples of such concessions, including with private sector financing, in a range of social and economic settings. The three new concession will directly address global biodiversity conservation priorities, and will be identified based on criteria developed by Government and partners, based on Burung Indonesia's existing biodiversity analysis, forest condition, social and economic issues. Potential target areas include the forests of the Wallacea region, which are poorly represented in the protected areas network. There are three inter-related components to the project: establishing partnerships and institutions to secure the finance and management capacity for successful conces</a><br />

The development and institutionalization of CRP as a key conservation initiative funded by the Government of Aceh will be an integral component of the program. CRP will pilot an innovative approach to promoting social integration and environmentally sensitive economic development in a post-conflict context, thus allowing concerned stakeholders to assess the suitability of the model for scale-up locally and for replication in other conflict-affected Indonesian provinces and abroad. The program has the following four objectives: a.   To improve the socio-economic welfare of 300-500 at-risk youths through skills training and job provision; b.   To improve the social integration of 300-500 at-risk youths through the provision of employment involving extensive interactions with local communities and with a strong orientation towards serving the public good; c.   To provide conservation services to target communities as part of Aceh's strategy for green economic development. d.   To institutionalize CRP as a government-led conservation initiative, placed under the supervision of a line-agency, with sustainable financing mechanisms (e.g. combination of provincial/district budgets, self-generated income, public/private partnership).</a><br />
