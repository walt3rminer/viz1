The SRMP will achieve these objectives through:  (i) an adjustment portion, providing immediate support to the poorest affected by the crisis (social risk mitigation); and (ii) an  investment portion, which consists of three components (a) building up the capacity of state institutions providing basic social services and social assistance to the poor (social risk management); (b) implementing a social assistance system (Conditional Cash Transfers - CCT) targeted to the poorest 6 percent of the population conditional on improved use of basic health and education services (social risk mitigation and prevention); and (c) increasing the income generation, employment opportunities and social service access of the poor (social risk prevention).</a><br />

At the same time, the project is designed to mitigate potential short-term adverse impacts of subsidy removal, and facilitate the transition to efficient production patterns.  Aside from promoting allocative efficiency, the reforms to be implemented are necessary for fiscal stabilization.  The agricultural policy reforms are supported in part financially by the Bank under the Economic Reform Loan (ERL).</a><br />
