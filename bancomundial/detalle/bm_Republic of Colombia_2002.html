The project is expected to displace an estimated 1.168 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (mtCO2e)  over a period of 21 years and will also support a social program that will contribute to improvements in the welfare of the local indigenous community.  The JCP, will contribute to the development of the international carbon market in Colombia through the supply of Emission Reductions (ERs), developed under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) as set forth under Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol.  By linking the global issue with local development concerns the project truly reflects the spirit of the CDM. The ERs are classified as high quality because of the reliability of the project and the social benefits represented by the social program for the indigenous people.</a><br />
