Specifically, the PRSC-4 focuses on supporting the government#s efforts to (i) improve the business environment and enhance governance and efficiency in the agriculture, energy and mining sectors; (ii) strengthen and modernize budget reporting, controls and accountability; and (iii) improve education and health outcomes through improved management of health and education human resources, fiscal decentralization and co-financing the contributions of the poor in the mutual insurance schemes.   The operation is an integral part of the Bank#s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Mali discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on February 5, 2008, and directly contributes to the CAS Strategic Objectives 1 and 2, complementing Specific Investment Lending (SIL) operations that directly support Mali#s growth and education sector reform.</a><br />
