In particular, the Grant will support reforms designed to deepen, broaden, and sustain the reforms underway in the areas of public administration and fiscal management, pro-poor spending, and natural resources management.  Improving transparency by sharing relevant information with stakeholders is also an important policy reform which this operation aims to support. Moreover, the proposed Grant helps the Government's efforts in revenue mobilization in the medium term through better governance in natural resources sectors.</a><br />
