This objective would be achieved by: (a) improving the reliability, efficiency and equity of distribution of available irrigation water; (b) increasing on-farm water use efficiency; and (c) enhancing long-term financial sustainability of the irrigation system by supporting the government's effort to foster self sustaining farmer organizations (FOs).</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">30000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P099046" target=_blank>The objective of the Project is to assist in delivering cost effective and sustainable community development programs and basic infrastructure services to under-served rural, urban and peri-urban communities (the communities) in AJK, using participatory community-based approaches, and, to that end: (a) to support an increase in the number and capacity of community representative organizations; (b) to enhance the capacity of the territorial, district and municipal governments to extend technical, financial and management support to community representative organizations; and (c) to generally enhance accountability and transparency through the establishment of improved operational, financial and budgeting procedures and monitoring and evaluation systems.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">150000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P098867" target=_blank>Objectives   The Pakistan PRSC 1 was the first in a series of three operations to support the implementation of the Government of Pakistan#s PRSP. The PRSP is grounded on four pillars: (i) achieving sustained high and broad-based economic growth, while maintaining macroeconomic stability; (ii) improving governance and consolidating devolution, both as a means of delivering better development results and ensuring social and economic justice; (iii) investing in human capital, with a renewed emphasis on effective delivery of basic social services; and (iv) targeting the poor and vulnerable, to bring the marginalized sections of the population and backward regions into the mainstream of development, and to make marked progress in reducing existing inequalities.  Outcomes:  The borrower is unable to obtain sufficient funds from other lenders on resonable terms or in a reasonable time.  This would be the first significant financing package to help the Government of Pakistan face immediate needs. The Supplemental Financing would support the sustained implementation of the PRSC reform program and help finance part of the gap in resources incurred as a result of the earthquake of October 8, 2005.</a><br />

Key pillars (development objectives) of the Punjab Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP) are:  (a) Public finance reforms to increase public spending for education (and other pro-poor services) and to ensure fiscal sustainability.  These include establishment of a Medium Term Budget Framework (MTBF) under which Punjab has been increasing public expenditures on education both at the provincial level, and by enhanced funding for district education budgets.  (b) Reforms that strengthen devolution and improve the fiduciary environment and governance.  These include (i) supporting devolution through measures that decentralize financing and decision making at the district level; increase accountability of districts for resource use; clarify the roles of all levels of government through the Terms of Partnership instrument; and strengthen the capacity of districts to assume their new responsibilities under decentralization; and (ii) strengthening the governance and fiduciary environment through better procurement and financial management practices.  (c) Education sector reforms to improve quality, access and sector governance.Sector governance includes strengthening the education department, improving teacher management (by increasing transparency in recruitment, reducing teacher absenteeism, achieving greater local involvement in teacher selection), revitalizing School Councils, strengthening monitoring & evaluation. Improvements in access include provision of critical incentives such as textbooks and stipends, and provision of missing facilities to the schools.  Improvements in quality focus on teacher professional development and improving the learning of students, including through better textbooks.  The status of agreed outcomes indicators below presents the end-of-program (i.e., after FY06) targets, as agreed in the overall framework of the Program for the three-year period.  However, the progress to date captures the performance under this second credit which supported FY05.  The section on intermediate indicators capture the targets for the current credit (i.e., second credit for FY05).</a><br />
