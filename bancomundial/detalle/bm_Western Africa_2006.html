The CB component would ensure that the construction and operations of the main pipeline is competently carried out, particularly with respect to World Bank environmental and social policies. The TA component would prepare the next investment phase including gas distribution networks, conversion-to-gas in the industrial, commencial and transportation sectors etc, and a possible extension of the main pipeline towards other countries.</a><br />

The developmental objective of this WAPP APL 1 (CTB Phase 2) Project of the Coastal Transmission Backbone Sub-Program (WAPP APL 1) is to assure more stable and reliable exchange of electricity between the national power systems of the WAPP Zone A Coastal States.  Outcomes  The expected outcomes include:  1. Increasing cross-border electricity trade between WAPP "Zone A" Coastal States; 2. Reductions in power transfer losses in the principal transmission networks of the WAPP "Zone A" coastal states; 3. More cost efficient coverage of peak power demand through economy power exchanges between WAPP "Zone A" coastal states.  The WAPP APL 1 project would be considered successful if it provides ample capacity for unconstrained cross-border electricity trade between the five ECOWAS Member States for up to at least 2020.</a><br />
