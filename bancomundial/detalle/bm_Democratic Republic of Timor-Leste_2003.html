<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P082942" target=_blank>The proposed project will provide support to two key government divisions involved in overseeing petroleum sector development: (1) the Timor Sea Office (TSO) in the Office of the Prime Minister; and (2) the Ministry of Planning and Finance (MOPF), specifically, the Timor Sea Tax Division (TSTD) and, separately, a petroleum revenue management function. The TSO has been the lead agency on all sector policy and strategic topics and has conducted all international negotiations; the TSTD is now facing rapidly escalating oversight demands; and there currently exists no office in the Government charged specifically with the critical task of implementing  a petroleum revenue management strategy. Funding for these  areas will focus on maintaining and increasing capacity in core functions, including the retention and/or recruitment of essential international advisers, the provision of programmed and just-in-time technical assistance, critical operating costs (e.g., travel for essential tax audits), and the provision of selected infrastructure for basic office functions.</a><br />
