<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P115829" target=_blank>The grant will support vulnerable and marginalized groups (locally identified) within communities to benefit from the Access to Info rmation law in Dominican Republic. In particular, the grant will strengthen the capacity of vulnerable groups to express their voice , participate in policy discussion, demand accountability and monitor government services that are key for increased social inclusio n and for reducing extreme poverty. Access to Information laws are a key tool for strengthening democratic governance. However, citi zens from major cities are usually the main beneficiaries and vulnerable groups and remote communities are left out of public progra ms on access to information widening the social gap among these two groups even more. The grant will contribute to design and implem ent mechanisms on a pilot basis to make information accessible to vulnerable and marginalized groups and ensure the information that  concerns them the most, is accessible to them. Moreover, the grant will create capacity within poor people and vulnerable groups to  analyze the information, and participate in policy discussions and program design. The community based organization that will be se lected to implement this grant will identify pilot municipalities from the poorest areas of the country in partnership with grassroo ts organizations according to the following criteria: (i) political will to implement the access to information law, (ii) some kind of information systems already in place, (iii) some transparency and accountability tools (i.e. participatory budgeting, social audi ts at the local level, etc.) already in place to be strengthened by improved supply of public information by the local government, a nd (iv) a critical mass of poor people, vulnerable groups, and/or remote communities in their territory. The proposed participatory methodology will be the main criteria for the selection of the implementing agency. The grant will leverage the existing network of community-based radio to reach vulnerable groups and support activities that will enhance participation of local communities in publ ic debates and the design of social programs.  Given the innovative nature of this approach, the experience will be documented and l essons learned disseminated so it can be applied to IDA countries using Access to Information Laws as an instrument for inclusive go vernance.</a><br />

Perez Rancier/Valle Nuevo National Park and its buffers, sequestering carbon in native forest and reforestation activities on 6,071 hectares.  It is designed to concurrently reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, help to alleviate rural poverty through payments for ecosystem services and creation of new jobs required by the reforestation, protect and enhance biodiversity, and improve water quality. The project development objective is to cause 500,000 tons of CO2 equivalent in carbon sinks with associated local benefits</a><br />
