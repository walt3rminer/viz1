They are to assist the Government of the Congo: (i) to slow down the spread of HIV/AIDS and (ii) to strengthen the support and care provided to individuals and families infected and/or affected by HIV/AIDS.   The objectives will be reached through a multi-sector approach preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, in particular by: (i) reducing transmission among high risk groups; (ii) expanding access to treatment of opportunistic infections (OIs) and to care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS (People Living with HIV/AIDS --PLWHA); and (iii) supporting civil society and community initiatives for HIV/AIDS prevention and care.  The project will support the implementation of the National Strategic Plan (Plan national strat?gique) for the period 2003-2007 and promote civil society and community initiatives for prevention and care put forward by beneficiary groups selected on the basis of the technical quality and likely impact of their proposals.  The National Strategic Plan is currently being prepared.  Its broad objectives are to: contain or reduce the level of the epidemic by 2007; mitigate the health and socioeconomic impact of HIV/AIDS at individual, household and community levels; and increase access to prevention services as well as care and support of those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS, in particular by developing local responses to the epidemic. The revised project development objective is to contribute to the recipient's efforts (i) to limit the spread of HIV/AIDS and STIs; (ii) to mitigate the health and socioeconomic impact of HIV/AIDS and STIs on persons infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS and STIs; and (iii) to build strong and sustainable national capacity to respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</a><br />

In order to achieve these objectives, the proposed Project will pursue a three-fold agenda of action.  1) it builds the capacity of  the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education to prepare the system for decentralization, in particular providing support to the Regional Departments of Education (RDE) to develop and monitor regional education plans, and strengthen their capacity to provide support to the school system; 2) it provides support to the improvement of quality of education services offered by  providing direct support to schools, through the implementation of a National School Improvement Program; and 3) provides support to increase equity in the provision of services, by providing free textbooks, allocating resources based on a per capita formula, focusing rehabilitation efforts in underserved areas, and providing support to out of school youth and excluded population such as pigmies.  The revised project development objective is to improve efficiency, quality and equity in the provision of basic education in theterritory of the Recipient with a view to achieving universal quality primary education by 2015.</a><br />
