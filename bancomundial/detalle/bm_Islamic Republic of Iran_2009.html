The project is based on the National Training Strategy. Background: During FY06-07 we had an active lending program in Iran, including a new TVET operation (P095165-LEN) with TVTO which was the follow-up to the National Training Strategy that we helped to develop (Grey Cover publication). In Spring 2006 a concept note was prepared and endorsed and subsequently a $1 million PPF was agreed with GoI for the preparatory work. In FY08, Bank management decided to stop all lending activities and thus the reason to drop the code. The PPF was closed on December 31, 2008 and the consultancy work completed and thus the code to be dropped.</a><br />
