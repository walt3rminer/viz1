The grant is not supporting direct investments and is more specifically focused on technical assistance. Indicators have been proposed by the FCPF to measurekey results related to progress in achieving strategic areas of REDD+. These indicators align with different aspects outlined in Madagascar’s R-PP and are used throughout the REDD+ Readiness process—corresponding to the implementation of the R-PP. The full list of 34 yes/no indicators is provided in Annex V of the Readiness Assessment Note, but this preparation grant will not be used to address all of the areas and indicators of REDD+ readiness. The result indicators for the PDO are related to the measures defined by the FCPF that are indicative of substantive progress towards REDD+ Readiness and are areas where the World Bank has a comparative advantage in providing support: • REDD+ strategy validated in broad consultation process;• REDD+ M&E system functional according to defined criteria;• Mechanism for tracking REDD+ strategy interventions in place.</a><br />
