This will be achieved through a cash for work program in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince where the largest number o f poor and vulnerable people live (around 1.2 million) and in a few key areas such as Gonaives and St Marc where another 500,000 dis placed persons have been housed temporarily. The Centre for National Coordination on Food Security, CNSA, and the Famine Early Warni ng Systems Network reported that as a consequence of the food, fuel, and financial crises, 2.8 million Haitians were food insecure i n 2008. Their precarious situation has been aggravated recently by the January earthquake.</a><br />

The operation supports the government's capacity to manage public resources efficiently and transparently. More specifically, the operation supports the following measures: (i) increasing transparency in budget transfers to the electricity sector; (ii) reinstating budget controls and external and internal audit processes; (iii) improving enforcement of the Law on Declaration of Assets; and  (iv) reinforcing public procurement regulation and enhancing transparency in procurement practices.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">15000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P118139" target=_blank>Building on the successful experience of the PCF-funded CDD pilot, the proposed project would scale-up the direct transfer of public resources to local community organizations in poor rural and peri-urban communities, by: (i) improving their access to basic social and economic infrastructure and support income-generating activities by financing small-scale investments proposed, implemented and managed by community organizations; and (ii) improving governance and building social capital of communities by increasing citizen participation and transparency in open decision-making processes.   Key indicators for the project would be (i) total resources transferred to OCBs over the life of the project; (ii) change in access to basic services as a function of subprojects implemented by OCBs; (iii) cost-effectiveness of infrastructure investments, compared with traditional service delivery mechanisms, and (iv) cost-benefit of productive subprojects.</a><br />
