Th e selected 6 provinces and 14 health zones are: Kwilu Province (Bandundu, Bagata, Masi-Manimba, Djuma); Maï-Ndombe Province (Mushie,  Kwamouth); East Kasai Province (Tshilenge, Kasansa); Lomami Province (N’Gandajika), Kasaï province (Bulape, Mushenge); and Central Kasaï province (Lubunga, Tshikula, Masuika). The PDO will be achieved by strengthening capacity at the referral and peripheral hea lth services level to detect and manage HAT using rapid diagnostic tests and the current standard of care and support uptake of new treatments once available. It will also strengthen community engagement in HAT detection and management so that affected communities  understand the risk of HAT, participate in case detection activities, and facilitate implementation of new treatments.</a><br />
