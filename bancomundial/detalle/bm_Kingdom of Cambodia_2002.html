Helping Cambodia on this agenda will involve a coordinated effort to shift civil service incentives to a sustainable basis and to create systems of accountable and transparent governance.  This project begins this process. It will provide a jump-start to capacity building through immediate bridge support for skill enhancement in key reform areas. The project will build capacity among a targeted cadre of government officials to carry out urgent and essential development tasks, while the basis for longer-term institutional development is being established. A hallmark of the project is to introduce innovative approaches to extend the reach of capacity building by leveraging new technologies, such as a Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) facility.</a><br />
