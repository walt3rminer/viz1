The development Objective of the REDP would be to increase the supply of least-cost electricity to the national grid from renewable energy sources on a commercial sustainable basis. There are two components under the REDP: 1. Renewable Energy Investment Component with total financing of $182 million, of which $100 milion by IDA. Under this component, a credit line will be provided to up to five participating banks to support renewable energy investment. 2. Regulatory Development Component with total financing of $3 million, of which $1 million from IDA. Under this component, technical assistance will be provided to strenghthen regulations and build capacity of concerned government bodies for renewable energy development. The carbon finance related component is the first component- Renewable Energy Investment Component</a><br />
