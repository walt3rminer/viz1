The development objectives of the project are (1) to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Environment to plan, implement and monitor an effective system of national protected areas in Cambodia, and; (2) to enhance its capacity for systematic environmental planning and management.  The proposed project builds upon the experience of the on-going BPAMP, and is designed to improve the policy and regulatory environment and strengthen institutional capacity for systematic and participatory management in protected areas (benefiting the globally-important flora and fauna and local communities living in and around these areas). At the same time, the project will support broader environmental management agenda through strengthening of EIA process, refinement and enforcement of environmental regulations, environmental monitoring and promoting good practices for pollution control.</a><br />
