This proposed loan would help meet the Government#s objective of obtaining stable and low cost financing as well as diversifying financing sources for its 2009 budget. This supports the Government#s concurrent goals of maintaining fiscal stability and addressing social needs through increased and more efficient spending. (2) Improving the outlook for economic growth, enhanced fiscal space for priority spending, governance, and poverty reduction. The loan supports a broad agenda of measures anchored in Guatemala#s efforts to increase fiscal resources for priority social spending to increase growth and reduce poverty, enhance governance and transparency as well as reduce financial sector market risk.  The agenda includes key actions of fiscal and institutional reforms to ensure that Guatemala can fully benefit from growth and the opportunities deriving from greater integration into the regional and world economy.  (3) Increasing the efficiency and transparency of public sector management. The public sector modernization efforts supported by the loan are expected to improve the efficiency of public expenditures, strengthen governance and fight corruption with a specific focus on government procurement and financial management. Efforts in these areas are also expected to foster an environment more conducive to investment and growth.</a><br />
