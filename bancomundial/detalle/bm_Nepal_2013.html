Food security will be realized through increased food availability, made possible by increasing productivity of agriculture, both crop and livestock. Nutrition security will be realized through improved dietary intake, made possible by promotion of diversifieddiets, and improved feeding and caring practices for pregnant and nursing women and children up to 2 years of age.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P127508" target=_blank>Project Development Objective: The main objective of the proposed project is to enhance government capacity to mitigate climate-related hazards by improving the accuracy and timeliness of weather and flood forecasts and warnings for climate-vulnerable communities, as well as developing agricultural management information system services to help farmers mitigate climate-related production risks.This would be achieved by establishing multi-hazard information and early warning systems, upgrading the existing hydrometeorological system and agricultural management information system, and enhancing capacity.  Activities funded through the project would help improve decision-making and planning in key climate-vulnerable and water resources dependent sectors particularly agriculture, health, water and disaster management, and contribute to building climate resilience for communities at risk.</a><br />
