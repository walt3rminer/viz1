The specific project development objectives are to: (i) implement the new mass rapid transit system on the basis of a Public Private Partnership (PPP) with concessioned bus corridor/feeder routes operations and fare collection system; (ii) improve access within low income areas through facilitating the use of low cost transport alternatives, such as bicycles and walking; (iii) strengthen the local institutional capacity to regulate and manage the metropolitan transport system on a sustainable basis; and (iv) reduce the negative environmental impact of motorized transport in Lima.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">20000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P077788" target=_blank>The project's development objectives are to assist the GOP to: (i) establish a more streamlined, integrated and effective institutional and policy framework to increase nontraditional exports, and (ii) develop and implement initiatives designed to foster the entrance of new export market participants, especially small and medium producers.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">52500000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P055232" target=_blank>The Program will support the Peruvian government's objective of improving the quality and equity of  basic education through focused investments in rural areas with the lowest education indicators and through systemic reforms of  teacher policy and education management.  This Project is the first one of a three-phase APL. Under Phase I, financing would be provided to support the implementation of key reforms of teaching and system management, initiate the investments in rural school infrastructure and quality enhancements, and pilot and evaluate alternative models of distance education at the secondary level.  Specifically, the  Project will:  (a) expand access to formal and non-formal initial and pre-school programs  in rural areas; (b) pilot and evaluate three different modalities of distance education in 116 secondary schools in the targeted rural areas; (c) improve primary school quality in rural areas through specially designed professional development programs for rural teachers focused on multigrade and bilingual education, distribution of improved learning materials, and rehabilitation of infrastructure where needed; and (d) raise sector efficiency through the implementation of the first phase of teacher policy reforms, restructuring of regional offices, initiating a decentralization process leading to more autonomous schools, with community voice in management,  and organizing rural school support network. To monitor quality and guide corrective strategies, the new national system of student assessment would be strengthened.</a><br />

The global objective of the project is to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity of global importance in Peru.</a><br />

This will make it possible to meet the target of component (ii) of the original project("expand services to the urban poor in the Pueblos Jovenes")which was the  Peru - Lima Water Rehabilitation & Mgt under ID P008051 - Loans 38110, 3811A, 3 811S. This objective was not reached under the original project  due to the fail ure of FONAVI to finance the associated secondary distribution networks.</a><br />
