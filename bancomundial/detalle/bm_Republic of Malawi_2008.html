The global environmental objective is to strengthen the natural resource base in agricultural lands through doubling the area under sustainable land management as a basis for securing ecosystem services and sustainable agricultural productivity. The project will (i) strengthen institutional capabilities necessary to further develop, and implement, a harmonized and aligned investment framework leading towards a full-fledged SWAp in the agricultural sector; (ii) increase the land, water and nutrient use efficiency of maize based rainfed cropping systems targeted by the Governmentâ  s Agricultural Development Programme; and (iii) increase the resilience of the maize supply system to cope with climate induced risks and shocks.</a><br />
