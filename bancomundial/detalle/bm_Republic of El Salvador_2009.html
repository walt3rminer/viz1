Within this context, the Project development objectives are to: (i) provide temporary income support to the urban vulnerable poor; (ii) improve the coverage of labor intermediation and training services to the urban vulnerable poor; and (iii) improve the institutional capacity of the Borrower to develop an integrated social protection system.</a><br />

The SSGER DPL is included in the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), which is being presented to the Board at the same time and complements other investment operations.  While the SSGER DPL will contribute to meeting the immediate financing needs of the Government, it will also serve as a bridge between the ongoing DPL and a possible programmatic DPL series in FY11 and FY12.</a><br />
