This rapid expansion has been caused by pent-up demand in the immediate post-conflict period and the abolition of school fees. Failure to provide timely assistance to schools as the system expands could result in the slowing or even reversal of this trend toward full primary enrollment. In this context, the overwhelming majority of project funding is focused on these urgent goals, which are normal in a post-conflict reconstruction environment. The second objective responds to the equally well-justified priority that the government gives to rapidly building its capacity to plan and manage the education sector, which will help the completion of an in-depth action plan that will increase the likelihood of attracting more external funding for its programs, including Fast-Track-Initiative's membership.</a><br />
