Thus, the main expected beneficiaries of the project are SMEs and their strategic partners. Other beneficiaries include public and private institutions that provide technology or quality services to the private sector â ranging from universities and public R&D centers to testing laboratories and quality certification consultants â and the units within the Ministry of the Economy in charge of implementing the countryâs policies in the areas of quality and innovation. Indeed, while ESPRIT will focus on co-financing innovation, quality enhancing and export projects developed by SMEs and associated companies, it will also provide complementary support to the expansion of the supply of technology and quality services for private firms, and the strengthening of the institutions in charge of El Salvadorâs technology and quality policies.  The achievement of the PDO will be measured against the following main project outcomes: (i) increased innovation and technology adoption by the SMEs and associated companies supported by the project; (ii) increased compliance with international quality standards and regulations by project supported SMEs and their partners; and (iii) increased exports and increased sales to large exporters by the SMEs supported by the project.  The following are the key performance indicators to assess progress towards the PDO.  (i) Number of firms that introduced new products and/or processes through ESPRIT-supported innovation projects: 50 by the end of the second year and 200 by the end of the project.  (ii) Number of firms supported by the project that received internationally recognized quality certifications: 20 by the end of the second year and 80 by the end of the project.  (iii) New exports generated by firms supported by the project: US$ 7 million by the end of the second year and US$ 31 million by the end of the project.</a><br />
