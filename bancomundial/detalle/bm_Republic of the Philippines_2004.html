The project is part of the Government's long-term developmental objective (i) to transform its Department of Agriculture into a more service and market-oriented agency; and (ii) to arrest and reverse the declining competitiveness  of the agriculture and fisheries sector by creating better conditions for agribusiness diversification and productivity-enhancing investments by the private sector.</a><br />

This will be achieved through the pilot use of innovative contractual mechanisms and GEF-funded Partial Credit Guarantee Program to promote private investment and financing.</a><br />
