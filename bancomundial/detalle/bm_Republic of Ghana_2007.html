The project seeks to establish a level playing field in the finance sector focusing upon outcomes rather than establishing new institutions, together with a clear policy to improve the efficiency of public sector management for an enhanced service delivery. The project, through support to FINSSP, will seek to catalyze the allocation of capital to Ghanaians and improve competitiveness and governance of long term savings institutions and markets. The project also aims to strengthen the Public Sector Reform Strategy through providing a framework for prioritization, consensus building and budgeting and to translate the strategy into detailed action plans supported by a thorough monitoring and evaluation mechanism. The objective of the Public Sector Reform component would be to facilitate a reform initiative in the public sector which would be comparable to that achieved through FINSSP in the financial sector in recent years. While this project component might support future implementation of selected activities under some of these action plans through collaboration with Development Partners, any more substantive engagement by the World Bank would be covered through a supplemental financing under this project. It is proposed to design this project component with an open architecture to maximize the involvement of interested Development Partners (DPs).</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">110000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P099287" target=_blank>This operation focused on three broad components of the new poverty reduction agenda (the GPRS II) organized under: (i) accelerated private sector-led growth, (ii) vigorous human resource development, and (iii) good governance and civic responsibility. While the PRSC-5 support translated primarily into funding for the implementation of last year's tranche of the GPRS II, particular attention was given to leveraging the poverty emphasis of several sector-focused operations by ensuring appropriate expenditure allocation (level and structure) and by addressing some of the financing implications of proposed policy actions (e.g., extension of capitation grants, removal of school fees, deployment of teachers and health care professional to under-served areas, and the implementation of an inclusive health insurance scheme).  The PRSC-5 also focused on cross-cutting issues related to private sector development and the strengthening of institutions, ranging from governance-related institutions to public sector reform, decentralization and public financial management.  Institutions related to public financial management received particular attention, since robust public financial management is critical to ensure the attainment of the objectives of a program receiving budgetary support.  Lastly, attention was given to monitoring poverty outcomes, ensuring that sector programs deliver results in terms of human development indicators. By helping to internalize these monitoring functions, the expectation is that the allocation of resources will begin to reflect the feedback from these results.</a><br />
