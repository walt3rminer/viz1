<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P085734" target=_blank>The objective of the project is to enhance biodiversity conservation and sustainable use of renewable natural resources in Okyeman (The Akyem Abuakwa Traditional Area) through community-based integrated natural resource management approaches. Specifically, this three-year project will focus on (i) improving the status of forest and wildlife resources; (ii) inventorizing forest and biodiversity heritage; (iii) enhancing local policies and regulations related to natural resources management; (iv)raising community awareness in environmental and natural resources management; and(v) developing and improving local economy and livelihoods. Okyeman is endowed with natural resources of global importance, including diverse terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity, endemic and globally threatened fauna and flora.  These resources are being destroyed by the adverse impacts of human activities such as deforestation, water pollution and over-harvesting of wildlife.  Recognizing the importance of nature and environmental conservation as the basis for the development of their people, the Traditional Authority is taking concrete steps to prevent further degradation of forest and water bodies in the traditional area.  This project will help to expand the scope of these initiatives, thereby optimizing their local and global environmental benefits and enhance sustainable forestry related economic activities.  It is expected that while this support will contribute toward ensuring environmental sustainability in the Akyem Abuakwa Traditional Area, it will also serve as a model partnership arrangement with traditional authority and when successful, could be replicated and scaled up in the country. The project is funded through a GEF Medium-Sized Program with a grant support of US$848,000 for a period of three (3) years.</a><br />
