<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P087292" target=_blank>The proposed project development objective is to demonstrate early success in large-scale, renewable energy development with participating local developers in one pilot autonomous region and one pilot province</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">320000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P091020" target=_blank>The project aims to increase the effective use of the road infrastructure in Fujian Province to support its social and economic development.  This objective seeks to contribute to: (i) improving living conditions in rural areas-particularly those in the areas of the Province where poverty rates are higher-by enhancing the transport accessibility of the rural communities to economic opportunities and social services; (ii) stimulating higher economic growth in Fujian Province by reducing transport costs; and (iii) facilitating the interconnection across the coastal provinces.  In this respect, the project will meet both the provincial government objective to improve the transport network to support the social and economic development of the province (especially in the economically lagging counties), and the central government objective to facilitate transport interconnections across Coastal Provinces.</a><br />
