<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">300000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P122875" target=_blank>Project Development Objective (Note: will be disclosed in the MOS) The proposed program will continue support effort to deepen Tunisia's global integration by strengthening firms competitiveness and innovation capacity and further integrate services.  The main areas of reform within the three pillars are: 1) Further the global integration of services. The measures considered as priorities include both horizontal measures aimed at improving the regulatory framework and increasing competition in services sectors, as well as vertical (or sectoral) measures to promote exports in services with a high commercial potential. The mission took note of the willingness of the government to reform the regulatory framework of services as a prerequisite for greater integration of the services sectors in the global economy. At sectoral level, the mission observed that many technical assistance and support programs are either ongoing or under preparation. In this context, it was agreed with the government that the ICL2 measures should not duplicate these sectoral programs, but could serve to complement them and reinforce the integration dimension. The ICL2 will therefore continue to play a coordinator and catalyst role in this field.  2) Strengthen the innovation system. The reforms discussed with the authorities regarding this pillar revolve around three axes: (i) to develop a government-wide coordination mechanisms and a strategy for innovation to determine clear goals and a framework in which the different modalities of the innovation interventions can be organized and prioritized; (ii) to rationalize public incentives and financing of innovation as well as fostering mechanisms to support the development of private financing instruments and; (iii) to improve the flexibility and the competitiveness of the national system of production and dissemination of knowledge.  D 3) Further improve business environment, with an emphasis on high valued added and innovating sectors. The mission identified priority measures along four axes: (i) make the business environment more attractive for investment; (ii) promote cross-border partnerships and the transfer of technology and expertise; (iii) simplify the incentive system and modernize the tax system, and (iv) improve the access to financing for firms, in particular for innovative business and for services.
