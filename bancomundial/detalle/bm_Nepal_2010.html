The expected impact is to increase the number of mobile applications entrepreneurs in Asia.  The expected intermediate results are the hosting of events to promote innovation in the mobile sphere, targeting around 1000 participants from 400 or so companies, NGOs, government agencies and other organizations that would participate in the online and offline actvities, and promoting the visibility of the Asian chapters at a global level, for instance through a dedicated webspace and competititions with winners to gain entry to international events, such as infoDev's Global Forum for Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Helsinki (May/June 2011) The main knowledge output of this activity will be inputs to the Mobile Flagship Report (GLO 1 under TF071399) to evaluate lessons learned from this experiment in social networking and to show the development potential of mobile applications.</a><br />

The Bank emergency program focuses on measures to address the short and medium to long term implications of the global food crisis for the country, including on going efforts to strengthen agricultural production and safety net mechanisms on a broad scale.  It is fully consistent with the Bankâs Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP).  The food crisis interventions will be financed out of the newly created Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund and through the restructuring of the existing portfolio.    Project Development Objectives Program Goal: To address the short and medium term implications of the global food crisis for the country by improving access to food and strengthening agricultural production, particularly for food insecure districts and smallholders. The project development objective of the Social Safety Nets Project is to ensure access to food and basic needs for vulnerable households in the short term in food insecure districts. The expected outcomes of the project are improved access to food in food insecure districts for vulnerable groups in the short term. The project development objective of the Irrigation and Water Resource Management Project remains unchanged and is to improve irrigated agriculture productivity and management of selected irrigation schemes and enhance institutional capacity for integrated water resources management.  The additional financing supports the intermediate outcome of Component D in the parent project: farmers in selected districts adopt better agricultural production and water management techniques. Additional monitoring indicators are identified and included in Annex 2.  The additional financing does not add new components to the IWRMP but provides financing to cover districts which are not currently included in the parent project. To enable Government to improve access to nutritious food for highly food insecure households in the short term and to create opportunities for improved agriculture production in food insecure districts.</a><br />
