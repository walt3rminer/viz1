This objective would be achieved by providing countries with: (a) better access to high quality diagnosis of HIV/AIDS infections; (b) a regional second-generation surveillance system for the epidemic; (c) cross/fertilization of better practices in epidemic prevention and control; and (d) mechanisms to reduce the mobile populations vulnerability to HIV/AIDS.</a><br />
