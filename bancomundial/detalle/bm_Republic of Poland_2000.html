Seaway modernization aimed at improving of the navigation safety and protection of maritime accesses to the port of Szczecin, managed by the Maritime Office of Szczecin (MOS). 2. Port Modernization aimed at construction and rehabilitation of physical internal port infrastructure, internal road circulation networks, storage facilities etc. under the direct management of the port authority of Szczecin and Swinoujscie (SSSA). The development objectives could be split in two categories: (i) Promote economic growth in the Szczecin-Swinoujscie region through improved maritime access. (ii) Facilitate private sector involvement in port operations in Szczecin. MOS and SSSA are responsible for monitoring of outputs. In particular MOS is monitoring safety of navigation at the Seaway (indicators such as accessibility ratios, number of accidents or near-accidents per year are being  recorded) while SSSA monitors the infrastructure facilities to be leased to private sector developers, following market demand. Indicators such as lease contracts signed with private operators (e.g., commitment letters, development schedules) and generated traffic compared to public investment are recorded.</a><br />
