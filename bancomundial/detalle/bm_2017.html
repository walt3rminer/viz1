This is intended to sustain the project and to promote con crete actions at the local level to respond to conflict analysis.  This will be achieved by working with local academic institutions  for data collection and analysis and to promote coordinated responses to the findings of the system. This objective will also bepro moted by seeking to generate a shared understanding among key stakeholders of violent conflict trends, as well as an appreciation of  the localized and nuanced nature of conflict both temporally and spatially.  It is intended that this will, in turn, inform better targeted interventions in specific locations to help prevent and manage violent conflict. By tracking trends, the dataset should als o provide information on the impact of various conflict mitigation measures implemented by government, donors and other institutions . It will also provide policy-makers with nuanced and regular data on which to measure the immediate impact of the Comprehensive Agr eement on the Bangsamoro and the anticipated transition to the new Bangsamoro political entity on security conditions on the ground.</a><br />

It will establish tangible improvements in transaction processing, reconciliation, and fiscal and financial reporting procedures; and improve budget management and resource allocation and administrative capacity to gradually develop Liberia's own institutional, organizational, informational, and human resource capacities.  The PFM Reform Strategy objectives against each of the themes are addressed in the project components as designed, where one or more objectives have been combined for efficiency and implementation sake.  The Strategy is anchored on five basic criteria: sequencing of major actions; simplicity and realism; lessons learned in prior reforms; ownership and sustainability; and partnership and collaboration.</a><br />

The project will focus on: (i) maintaining and growing the railway business (increase revenue from US$219 million today to about US$283 million by 2015) by providing the profitable freight market segment with proper service, infrastructure and locomotive capacity; (ii) transforming the Azeri Railways into a financially self-sustainable operation in freight transportation, covering all its costs (including infrastructure maintenance and traction) from revenues, while improving its operational efficiency; and (iii) improving the transparency of the Railway sector by introducing International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and profit centers  (passenger/freight) and by separating on an accounting basis passenger service that could be self-sustained from others.   Other parts of the Government Program are expected to be covered through separate projects once the proper financial and technical due diligence has been completed.</a><br />

The increase in carbon sink will not change the nature of the Savannah ecosystem. The reforestation will be implemented in traditional forest areas around the piedmont of the Andes. The BioCarbon Fund intends to purchase around 200,000 t CO2e in carbon sinks. A letter of intention has already been signed. A letter of no objection from the Designated National Authority has also been received. The project has also the endorsement of the BCF Committee and has been vetted by the Sector Manager for LCSEN.</a><br />
