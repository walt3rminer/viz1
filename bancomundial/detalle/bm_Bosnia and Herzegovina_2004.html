The first component on "reducing the excess burden of government in the economy while increasing expenditure efficiency" has three sub-components. The objective of the first sub-component on public sector employment and pay reform is to rein in the public sector wage bill to improve macroeconomic stability and spending efficiency, while initiating structural reforms to modernize the wage determination system in harmony with more general public administration reform objectives. The second sub-component aims at reforming inter-governmental fiscal relations by: (i) further improving intergovernmental policy coordination; (ii) increasing budgetary discipline and accountability across levels of government; (iii) clarifying and rationalizing expenditure and revenue assignments; and (iv) improving the systems of intergovernmental transfers. The objective of the third sub-component on reforms in higher education finance is to achieve greater efficiency through rationalization of expenditure assignments and reform of the university system. The second program component on "improving financial and budgetary management in the public sector" also has three sub-components. The objecting of the first on budget preparation is to further strengthen medium-term budgetary programming through the regular preparation of medium-term expenditure frameworks that will improve annual budgeting as well as enhance fiscal policy coordination. The second sub-component on budget execution, reporting and accountability aims to capitalize on the progress realized with the introduction of the Treasury system to enforce discipline in budget execution, avoid accumulation of payment arrears and improve macroeconomic management through the preparation of regular, timely and comprehensive budget execution reports. The final sub-component on transparency and integrity in the management of public resources aims to reduce the scope of corruption and influence peddling through the adoption and enforcement of improved legislation on public procurement and conflict of interest.</a><br />
