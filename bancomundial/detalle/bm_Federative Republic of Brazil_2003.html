The gains that have been obtained over the last few years are tangible, but they can be vulnerable especially in the face of a political transition and an unstable economic environ ment. For this reason, the operation should focus on (a) the maintenance  of the human welfare gains under an unstable context, and (b) the enhancement of such gains in the longer term, by assisting the country in incre asing the efficiency of the delivery of human development services  (doing more with the same, or doing the same with less.)  A clear limitation, however, is that the operation can generate no additionality of resources to the sectors.  Board Schedule Comments</a><br />
