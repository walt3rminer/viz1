Within a medium-term framework, and building on the previous budget support operation (RSRC-1) as well as ongoing projects in agriculture, education, health, and population (upcoming), this two tranche operation will continue focusing on overcoming policy constraints and institutional bottlenecks in: (i) public sector management; (ii) agricultural growth and rural development; and (iii) human development, including demographic growth and gender issues. This operation, like its predecessor, will support a strategic subset of the Government PRSP policy and reform agenda. In the subsequent DPL (RSRC-3), the human and rural development agenda will be gradually phased out, while policy reforms to promote private sector development (business environment, finance, infrastructure, utilities) will be emphasized.</a><br />
