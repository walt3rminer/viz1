The project's overall objective is to demonstrate the viability of ecological corridors in conserving biodiversity in the Brazilian Amazon and Atlantic rainforests. The project is divided in two phases: The first phase will take approximately 18 months and will focus largely upon establishing the institutional infrastructure for the Central Amazon (CAC) and Atlantic Forest(CAFC) corridors, and developing management plans based upon multi-disciplinary studies of biodiversity and related economic, social and political characteristics relevant to successful corridor management. It will also launch the first conservation initiatives and pilot techniques derived from the corridor management plans. By the end of the 18 month-phase it is expected that significant progress will have been made in establishing prototype corridor management institutions and plans that would orient implementation efforts in the second phase. During the second phase, with an expected duration of 42 months, the project will focus on the consolidation of corridors monitoring and vigilance systems, implementation of corridors management plans and implementation of sub-projects in interstitial areas.</a><br />

The Financial Sector Technical Assistance project was prepared in parallel to the first phase of programmatic lending, and was intended to facilitate the achievement of reforms targeted for the subsequent stages, as well as reinforce, in the medium term, institutional capacity  at the two key financial sector regulatory agencies in Brazil; the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, Brazil.s central bank) and the Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM, Brazil's securities commission).  Technical assistance is targeted at a number of areas which are included in the scope of the reform program and which would support the overall effectiveness of the supervisory agencies. Specifically, assistance to the Central Bank would include: support for the reduction of interest rates and spreads, strengthening of banking supervision, regulation, and failure resolution as well as enhanced preparedness for banking sector difficulties, payments system reform, and finally, support to increase the overall efficiency of the Central Bank through a follow up to Bank-assisted diagnostic work  on information technology systems. Support to the CVM would focus on: strengthening compliance, supporting greater transparency and better monitoring of corporate financial accounting and disclosure, improving market surveillance, strengthening investor protection and public information, and finally, undertaking diagnostic studies on the present and future roles, resources and responsibilities of capital market regulatory agencies.</a><br />
