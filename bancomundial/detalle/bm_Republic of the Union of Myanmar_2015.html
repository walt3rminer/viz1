In the near-term (2013-2015), the main challenges are: (i) to maximize efficiency of power generation, reduce losses in transmission and distribution networks, and reduce electricity shortages; (ii) to improve financial viability of sector enterprises; (iii) to secure affordable funding for capital investments in urgently need power generation. In the medium to longer term, the main challenge facing the energy sector is to secure reliable, affordable and environmentally and socially sustainable energy supply. These challenges are detailedin the Outline of Energy Development Policy, prepared by the Bank and broadly agreed with Myanmar's National Energy Management Committee in 2013.# Demand for electricity in Myanmar has grown significantly in recent years. The annual peak load demand reached 1,850 mega-Watts (MW) in 2013, growing on average 7.7 percent per annum in the past five years. During this same time, the electric energy supplied to the national grid grew on average almost 12 percent per annum. Electricity shortages and supply disruptions remain prevalent in the country.# The World Bank Group (WBG) is responding to the near-term challenges in multiple ways. The Myanmar Electric Power Project was approved in September 2013 and will be financing 110 MW of new generation capacity to be added to the national grid. The project provides technical assistance on designing the National Electrification Plan and preparing a project to implement electrification program, powersector financial viability, and electricity tariffs and subsidies review. The IFC is advising the Ministry of Electric Power to develop a business model for private participation in power generation. The IFC is also reviewing investment prospects in the distribution sector through the Yangon Electricity Supply Board, and in grid and off-grid private power generation projects.# To continue WBG supports to the Myanmar power sector, this proposed project aims to facilitate the development of new power generation capacity by the private sector by offering an IDA guarantee to mitigate selected risks facing private sector lenders and investors to Myanmar, and help reduce the cost of electricity supplied by independent power producers (IPP).# With advisory support from IFC, the Myanmar's Ministry of Electric Power has launched a competitive tender for the development of the Myingyan Independent Power Producer Project (Myingyan IPP) by the private sector with scheduled commercial operations planned for late 2015. The project cost is expected to be between US$ 250 and 300 million and will be financed mostly by international lenders and investors. To support project development, the Government is in preliminary discussions with the Bank Group on risk mitigation solutions for the project, such as IDA Partial Risk Guarantee (PRG) and MIGA guarantees. The availability of WBG risk mitigation solutions is expected to broaden the appeal of the project to a wider group of private lenders and investors, enhance competition in project development, which may result in a lower overall project cost. Specifically the IDAPRG will facilitate the participation of international commercial lenders and provide additional financing alternatives for project developers, in addition to bilateral and multilateral development financial institutions operating in Myanmar.# The expected PDO is to increase the available electricity generation capacity by the private sector in Myanmar.# The expected results will be a successful development of a new gas-fired power generation plant by the private sector within specification, schedule and budget. The IDA Guarantee will help mobilize international commercial debt financing for the first internationally tendered private power project in Myanmar.# The project indirectly helps contribute to the achievement of th</a><br />
