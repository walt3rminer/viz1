Encouraging low-income Nigerian families to enroll in pre-paid health insurance plans as a way to access affordable primary and maternal care, as well as treatment for prevalent diseases;  2. Increasing the utilization and efficiency of idle private sector capacity to meet the country#s healthcare needs, instead of constructing new public facilities;  3. Establishing and strictly enforcing standards of care in the private health sector, thereby restoring confidence among insurance beneficiaries; and,  4. Demonstrating the viability and long-term sustainability of community health plans to encourage other HMOs to offer affordable and appropriately designed health insurance plans to low-income populations.</a><br />

More specifically, the project would: (i) strengthen capacities for system management at the state level and encourage an environment of broad based consultation; (ii) support improvements in the delivery of primary health care services with a particular focus on maternal and child health and reproductive health services; and (iii) assist the Federal Government to strengthen its policy formulation and further develop a system to monitor the health sector performance.</a><br />
