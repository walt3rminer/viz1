This will be achieved by:  (i) building an integrated market access and trade facilitation infrastructure; (ii) proactively supporting entrepreneurship development; (iii) developing and strengthening, on a sustainable basis, the capacity of local intermediaries to deliver financial and non-financial services to MSMEs, and MSMEs to make productive use of these services; (iv) reducing selected business constraints, including technical barriers to trade, faced by MSMEs; (v) providing an enabling environment (access to finance, trade promotion, and trade facilitation infrastructure) to boost increased investments I the MSME sector; and (vi) enhancing the facilitation, project development, and implementation roles of the Government</a><br />
