IDA support for the Government?s financial sector reform program would be a programmatic development policy operation in two phases.  The first phase?the proposed Credit?would be executed over a period of two years.  The proposed Credit would support the institutional development of the financial sector through reforms in the following five areas: (i) Strategy for management of systemic risks (ii) Strengthening of legal and regulatory framework (iii) Anti money laundering and financing of terrorism prevention system (iv) Strengthening of supervision and control of systemic risks (v) Strengthening of the payments system.  A second development policy credit would support an orderly consolidation of the financial system.</a><br />
