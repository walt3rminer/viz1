The experience of the grants and the capacity-building support in the JSDF pilot areas will be captured throu gh partnership with national and local government officials in a new framework for participatory village planning, which will be app lied across Rwanda. * The project will be implemented in four districts, seven sectors and 249 villages, which constitutes 10-12 p ercent of the villages in the project districts. The total population in the target villages, according to official data, is 152,645 . This entire number is expected to benefit from improved village planning and engagement with local government, including enhanced understanding of and access to government social protection programs. On average, just over 70 households in each target village wil l attend meetings and benefit from a range of activities, including capacity-building for planning and savings groups. This equates to 17,750 HH, for a total of approximately 76,000 direct beneficiaries.</a><br />
