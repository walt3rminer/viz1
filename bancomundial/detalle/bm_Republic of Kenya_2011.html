The Arid and Semi-Arid Lands SWAp will build on the Arid Lands Resource Management Program 2 by taking into account important lessons learned and by adressing opportunities and challenges that have emerged as being crucial for the development of arid and semi-arid regions. The Program will focus on (i) deepening institutional reforms at national, district and local levels; (ii) further strenthening the drought management systems, in particular drought preparedness; (iii) increasing the viability of livelihoods of the ASAL (Arid and Semi-Arid Lands) population; and (iv) assisting the Government to prepare spatial growth strategies. The Arid and Semi-Arid Lands SWAp aims at bringing together various Development Partners to allow for a harmonzied and coordinated support for the development of the ASAL.</a><br />
