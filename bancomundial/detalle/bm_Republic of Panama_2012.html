This project will support the regional offices of the Ministry of Health in Panama to deliver a package of basic health and nutrition services to the population not covered by social health insurance in the country#s rural areas.  This project will finance capitation payments for the delivery of this basic package through both mobile teams and through fixed health facilities managed by NGOs or by the Ministry of Health itself.  The project would also support the strengthening of the stewardship role on the health system of the Ministry of Health.</a><br />
