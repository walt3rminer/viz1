The project would contribute to the government's National Poverty Eradication Program (NPEP) under preparation. The objectives of the project are to (i) improve the security of land tenure; (ii) develop transparent and efficient land administration institutions at the national and provincial levels; and (iii) improve the government's capacity to provide social and economic services through broader revenue base from property related fees and taxes. These objectives would be achieved through formulating and approving land policy and regulatory changes, strengthening institutional capacity and project management, accelerating land titling activities in areas of high demand, developing and implementing an efficient and transparent land registration system, and strengthening land valuation systems.</a><br />
