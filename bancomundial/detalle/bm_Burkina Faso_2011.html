This operation also supports the authorities to implement a continuation of reforms under the PRSP-II and the new poverty reduction strategy which aims to facilitate faster growth and sustainable development (Stratégie de Croissance Accélérée et de Développement Durable or SCADD). The development objectives of PRSG-11 are to: (i) improve the investment climate and promote exports with six intermediate results: (a) private investment in strategic sectors through public-private partnerships; (b) export facilitation; (c) liberalization of trucking industry; (d) competitiveness of the cotton sector; (e) increased private sector participation in formerly state-owned companies in the mining, transport and tourism sectors; and (f)transparency and certainty of rural land tenure, and (ii) promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources. The proposed operation is an integral part of the World Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy for FY10-12 and remains aligned with the overarching principle of aid harmonization as defined in the joint donor framework known as CGAB.</a><br />

All of the above are covered by project activities. A further assumption is that increased economic activity in the BagrÃ© region will lead to increased job creation in the area and that the labor intensity of the supported agribusiness activities is relatively high.</a><br />

Development Objective of the Project The BEPSG-2 Supports the government's Basic Education Sector Program which aims to (i) Improve access, equity, and expand coverage of basic education (which includes preschool, lower secondary education, and secondary vocational, as well as literacy programs), (ii) Improve quality, efficiency, and relevance of basic education, and (iii) Strengthen sector management including administrative, fiduciary and pedagogic management, partly through decentralization of basic education services. Comments on grant approval process Burkina Faso has requested and obtained assistance from the Education for All Fast Track Initiative - Catalytic Fund (FTI_CF) in the amount of US$102 million to help finance its Ten-Year Basic Education Development Program (PDDEB).  Burkina Faso has requested that the Grant of US$ 102 million be disbursed in three tranches in the form of development policy operations supervised by IDA. Comments on process of mobilizing trust funds and grants After approval of the Grant, the Bank team undertook the processing according to Bank's rules, and to date there has been no delay in mobilizing and making funds available. Comments on Financing Plan The total cost of implementing the program from July 2009 to the end of 2011 is estimated at US$ 1.051 billion.  Available government financing is estimated at US$ 652 million and commitments from donors currently active in the sector are US$ 280 million; leaving a financing gap of US$ 120 million from which the FTI steering committee has provided US$ 102 million as a grant. The government expects to fund the remaining amount through increased national budget allocated to the sector.</a><br />
