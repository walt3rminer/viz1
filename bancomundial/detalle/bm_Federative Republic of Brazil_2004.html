In other words, the e nvironment would be considered upstream in sector policy decisions, particularly by Finance and Planning, and be handled under a more integrated approach, as opposed to a more antagonistic and adversarial one.  It is p erhaps only through a SAL operation that this can realistically be  achieved, and conversely a SAL operation s eems very appropriate to achieve such an objective.  The loan can  potentially also help bridge administration s, ensuring continuity and sustained environmental activities, helping  prevent the classic 18 month letdown t ypically faced during such periods.  In the wake of the project, we  believe many steps forward will be achieved by the environment sector in Brazil.  Board Schedule Comments</a><br />
