These objectives will be accomplished through key mitigation measures designed to: (i) isolate and protect abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps from disturbance by natural processes such as landslides and floods, and from leaching and dispersal processes associated with ground- and surface-water drainage; isolate long-standing hazards and prevent their disturbance; (ii) create an effective disaster management and response system; and (iii) develop a system to detect and warn against active landslide movements in about 20 key hazard areas.</a><br />
