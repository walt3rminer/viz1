<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">5000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P076961" target=_blank>The development objective of the proposed Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) is to assist the Government of Jordan (GOJ) to improve horticultural export marketing by pilot testing: (i) a system of outgrower farming between large and small/medium scale farmers (henceforth called outgrowers) in order to achieve critical mass or bulk volumes demanded by the target markets and improve the income of participating farmers; and (ii) the building of the technological capacity of farmers, especially the outgrowers, to improve crop husbandry practices and their produce quality to satisfy the requirements of target markets and reduce the rejection rates of exported consignments. PDO achievement will be measured by the number of horticultural exporters and export-oriented producers, and their export volumes and values, as well as the area under horticultural production compliant with GAP standards. As this LIL tests the appropriateness of a tool (i.e. contract farming) to achieve these objectives, target values cannot be set for the objectives themselves, but rather for the service structures (such as Horticultural Export Promotion Department created and operational"; "16 Technology Transfer Specialists employed"; "quality testing laboratory upgraded and operational") which aim at improving the business environment for using this tool. In addition, the LIL will produce a number of "knowledge objects" such as case studies on contract farming arrangements, analyzing the key determinants for the arrangements actually found.</a><br />
