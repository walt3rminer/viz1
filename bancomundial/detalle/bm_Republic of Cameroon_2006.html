<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P089289" target=_blank>The global environmental objective of the proposed project is to enhance the sustainable land and natural resource management components of the PAPNDP project by complementing the local and national benefits of SLM with key global benefits such as:   1. Conservation of globally significant above and belowground biodiversity.   2. Reduction of carbon emissions via improved land management activities, rehabilitated degraded lands, and increased carbon sequestration.   3. Stabilizing riparian zones and reduction of sediment discharge into critical trans-boundary water bodies such as Lake Chad and the Gulf of Guinea.  The global objective will be accomplished by the following components (see Annex 4 for a detailed description and Annex 5 for a detailed cost breakdown):   1. Enhancing integration of SLM into local development activities. Assist communes and communities in identifying key land management constraints and opportunities for improved productivity, ecosystem services, and global environmental benefits.  Implement priority microprojects to stop and reverse land degradation and thus enhance the conservation of globally significant biodiversity including agro-biodiversity .   2. Institutional support for SLM. Reinforce institutional collaboration at the national level, and strengthen the capacities of beneficiaries to better integrate SLM best practices in their local development plans. Implement and improve conflict resolution frameworks and mechanisms in collaboration with traditional chiefs to effectively mitigate tensions among farmers, cattle herders, protected area and other natural resource users.   3. Project management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and communication. Ensure proper project management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation, communication, and dissemination of lessons learned.</a><br />
