The second PRSC would support the Government#s efforts to strengthen the effectiveness and future fiscal viability of the pay-as-you-go pension program by supporting efforts to complete the 1999 pension reform, including efforts to unify the pension system for all types of pensioners. With higher energy and food prices likely to persist for some time to come, improving targeting efficiency of social assistance programs and gaining efficiency in program administration will be necessary elements of Moldova#s poverty reduction efforts.</a><br />

Social insurance contributions are also planned to be unified to reduce compliance costs.</a><br />

A key priority will be the consolidation of the reforms initiated under the first PRSC series (PRSC 1, 2 and 3), mainly to further refine the regulatory and institutional governance framework which has been developed since 2003, to close existing gaps, and to improve impact of governance related activities.  Additional support will be given to governance reforms, in particular governance challenges in selected entities such as the revenue agencies and in sensitive sectors such as the forestry and the mining sectors. Reforms in these areas will provide an important test for the efficiency and effectiveness of the existing governance framework. Regarding basic service delivery, the objective of the series is to accompany the process of institutional strengthening and quality improvements underway in the sectors.  More specifically, the PRSCs will complement the Bank#s existing investment portfolio by reinforcing institutional rationalization and strengthening in nutrition and by supporting the implementation of sector-wide approaches in health, education and water supply.</a><br />

The development objective of the social reforms is to promote social inclusion so that all individuals in society benefit from development and government programs. Priority actions focus on BPS#s efforts to expand non-contributory family allowances program to all eligible households operating in the informal sector and improve the coverage and contributions to the formal social security system.</a><br />

The focus of the Government's program is now shifting toward building capacity to deliver services throughout the Government.  The PSIB program is expected to transition to a new program supporting an extension of reforms from the center to line ministries and provinces, with an emphasis on accountability.  This new series would support the full ANDS, which GoA expects to finalize by mid-2008.</a><br />

These would in turn yield more efficient rail operations and services to users, improve financial performance, and provide the basis for a growing market share for the railway sector.</a><br />
