The reforms proposed to be supported aim to: (i) improve public financial management to enhance the efficiency of public spending and the Government’s revenue-raising capacity through better enforcement of tax laws; (ii) improve governance of SOEs in the energy sector to generate savings, and attract the private capital needed to modernize plants and increase their competitiveness; and (iii) enhance fiscal sustainability of public health care through the reduction of unjustified outlays and the reallocation of resources to high-return preventive care and health promotion programs. In addition, the DPL-DDO contributes to the Government’s fiscal buffer, but without requiring actual disbursement of funds. The overarching objective of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2009-2013, updated by a Progress Report was presented to the Board in December 2011, is to pursue public sector reform, growth and competitiveness, and social and spatial inclusion. The DPL-DDO approaches these reform objectives from the perspective of fiscal sustainability, which the Government sees as a prerequisite for the longer term growth under the CPS.</a><br />
