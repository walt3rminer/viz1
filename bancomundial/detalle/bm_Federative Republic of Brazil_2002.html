This operation resulted from the restructuring of the Second Water Sector Modernization project (Loan  4292-BR), following a request from the Brazilian government as a result of Congress approval of the Fiscal Resposibility Law.  Project restructuring kept the federal government as borrower of the technical assistance component and upgraded the other two implementing agencies (CAIXA and BNDES) to borrowers.  CAIXA and BNDES are now independent projects.</a><br />

The proposed Project would be the first phase (Phase 1) of a 10-year ARPA program. The Project's objective will be achieved by: Creating 18 million hectares in new protected areas (9 million hectares of strict protection PAs and 9 million hectares of sustainable use. The 11 Sustainable use protected areas have the goal of conserving biodiversity as well as supporting the communities living in them. These protected areas are regulated by management plans that include various use zones, some of which protect key environmental values of these areas , including, in particular, a strict protection zone. ARPA will support only surveillance and enforcement activities in the sustainable use protected areas to ensure ecological integrity and biodiversity conservation. ,, Other objectives include: -,,Consolidating the management of 7 million hectares of existing strict protection PAs in addition to 9 million hectares of the newly created strict protection PAs,, -,,Establishing and operating an endowment fund to meet the recurrent costs of protected areas,, -,,Establishing and operating a biodiversity monitoring and evaluation system at the protected area and regional levels  The key performance indicators for Phase I are: -,, 23 ecoregions in the Brazilian Amazon analyzed for identification of new PAs -,,18 million hectares of new PAs (9 million hectares of strict protection PAs and 9 million hectares of sustainable use PAs) created -,,7 million hectares of existing strict protection PAs and 3 million hectares of new strict protection PAs consolidated and managed -,,An endowment fund for financial sustainability of existing strict protection PAs established and capitalized with a minimum of US$14.5 million -,,Demonstration projects for financial sustainability of PAs implemented -,,An environmental monitoring methodology for specific PAs defined and -,,Program Committee, Conflict Mediation Committee, and two project coordination units (one in the Ministry of Environment (MMA) and one in the Brazilian Biodiversity Fund (FUNBIO) created and operational</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">5000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P074777" target=_blank>The objective of the Municipal Pension Reform Project (PREV-MUN# or Programa de Apoio a Previdencia dos Municipios in Brazil) is to  upgrade municipal pension management. The specific objectives are to:  (i) address critical pension problems in 26 of Brazil's most important municipalities comprising many state capitals plus large muni cipalities, and (ii) strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Social Security and Social Assistance (MPAS) to carry out its legal mandate to provi de technical assistance, monitor and evaluate pension management and validate performance. Note that if loan objectives are met successfully they will contribute to the alleviation of much of municipal pension debt since ar ound 90% is accounted for by the largest 50 municipalities. Also, problems in other municpalities will be addressed as the large mun icipalities will be "multipliers" and examples for smaller/contiguous ones.</a><br />
