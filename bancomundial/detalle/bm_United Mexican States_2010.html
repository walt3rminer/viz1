The project also seeks to assess the overall impacts of climate change on national water resource planning, including the identification of potential response options, with a focus on coastal wetlands and associated watersheds. The experience from the project pilots is intended to inform the government's future adaptation strategy and development programs in the Gulf region.</a><br />

In addition, the proposed operation will contribute to the efforts of the Mexico government to: (i) facilitate Mexico?s involvement in the international carbon market, and (ii) implement Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), in particular the ones adopted in the PECC.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">1250000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P122349" target=_blank>The proposed project would finance Mexicoâs conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, Oportunidades, which serves about 5 million poor families.  About 70 percent of these families are in rural areas, 16 percent live in semi-urban areas, with the remaining 14 percent in urban areas.  The principal project development objectives are:   â¢ Complement the income of poor families with children  â¢ Increase the accumulation of human capital in extremely poor families throughimprovements in their access to education, health and nutrition.  â¢ Improve program quality  In the area of program quality, the project would support several innovations being tested by the Program which aim at improving for Oportunidades families, the quality of health and education services received,  linkages to other services (for example, early childhood development programs, tertiary level educational scholarships and employment services), and ethnic pertinence.  Oportunidades is a mature major social assistance program, with a positive impact already well demonstrated through rigorous evaluations in many important areas â higher consumption (particularly âhigh-qualityâ food consumption (fruit and vegetables)), reductions in poverty levels, child labor, infant and maternal mortality and disease, adult illness and chronic disease, and higher school enrollment (concentrated at the transition from the primary to the secondary level).  Thus continued implementation of the Program according to its established procedures would achieve the first two development objectives.  The following key indicators will be used.   The correspondence of each indicator to the development objectives is shown in Annex 3. In some cases reference is made to the evidence already accumulated.  For the improvements in program quality, there are a set of indicators related to the design and implementation of each innovative activity.  â¢ Net improvement in household total, food (including fruits and vegetables) and protein consumption.  â¢ Net improvement in child nutrition status and in adult and child health status  â¢ Net change in school enrollment, attendance and drop-out.  â¢ Total number of municipalities, localities, families, and children in Oportunidades.  â¢ % of families certifying health conditions  â¢ % of families who comply in health, by age, population and state.  â¢ % of children aged 4 and below who are malnourished  â¢ % of children certifying education conditions  â¢ % of children who comply in education, by age, population and state.  â¢ % of students who stay in school for entire year.  â¢ % which transit to the next educational level  â¢ % of families with two or more children who receive the maximum transfer amount  â¢ Number of entries and exits of Oportunidades beneficiaries by cause.</a><br />

Consistent with its development objective, the PDO for Phase II (the Project) is to strengthen PEC by increasing overall coverage and social participation in Eligible Schools while putting greater emphasis on public marginalized schools and on the indigenous population, as well as a reorientation of the School Grants to improve public schools' internal efficiency and learning outcomes.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">450000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P120134" target=_blank>The objective of the proposed operation is to support the government's efforts to advance its strategy for adaptation to climate change in the water sector by strengthening institutions, regulations and monitoring capacity in integrated water resources management, as well as incorporating incentives in the normative frameworks and financing mechanisms of various water sub-sectors. The proposed DPL supports the government#s policy commitment to adaptation to climate change in the water sector, including the allocation of institutional and financial resources and strengthening of monitoring and evaluation capacity.  Reduced water availability and poor water quality are two of the main factors affecting future growth and development in Mexico. Key to addressing these development challenges is the enactment of measures to adapt to climate change whose aim is ensuring proper water resources management through appropriate regulations, norms, institutional reforms, and financial mechanisms.  The operation will support the GOM's efforts to foster adaptation to climate change in the water sector, contributing to long-term sustainable growth and protecting the most vulnerable populations.</a><br />

The programmatic series would support actions in the following three areas addressing the key constraints of the EMS system: (i) improving flexibility of upper secondary education; (ii) enhancing quality and relevance of education; and (iii) reducing opportunity cost of upper secondary education. This will be accompanied by the development of robust monitoring mechanisms providing up-to-date information on the performance of schools and individualized data for parents on the learning achievement of their children.</a><br />
